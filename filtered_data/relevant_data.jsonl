{"Paper Title": "Integrating machine learning and Monte Carlo Simulation for probabilistic assessment of durability in RC structures affected by carbonation-induced corrosion", "Abstract": "This study introduces an original approach that integrates a machine-learning algorithm and a Monte Carlo simulation technique to evaluate the durability of reinforced concrete (RC) structures subjected to carbonation-induced corrosion. The study commences by forecasting the carbonation depth of concrete samples subjected to natural conditions, employing Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with the backpropagation algorithm. A database was created by gathering information from 870 literature sources, and it was utilized to build 100 ANN models with different topologies. A rigorous evaluation was conducted to identify the most efficient ANN architecture. Subsequently, the approach was applied in a case study to evaluate the design life of structures in a real scenario, thereby demonstrating its tangible value in real-world applications. In addition, a parametric study was undertaken to examine the material’s compressive strength and the thickness of the concrete cover, which influences its durability. The design life was determined using the Monte Carlo Simulation technique coupled with the ANN model, in which the probability of depassivation due to carbonation was forecasted. Findings indicate that decreasing the concrete cover by 25% would lead to a 48% decrease in the structure’s design life, highlighting the influence of accurately determining and implementing the thickness of the concrete cover for RC structures."}

In this work, a vision foundation model is introduced for crack segmentation. Two parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, adapter and low-rank adaptation, are adopted to fine-tune the foundation model in semantic segmentation: the Segment Anything Model (SAM). The fine-tuned CrackSAM shows excellent performance on different scenes and materials. To test the zero-shot performance of the proposed method, two unique datasets related to road and exterior wall cracks are collected, annotated and open-sourced, for a total of 810 images. Comparative experiments are conducted with twelve mature semantic segmentation models. On datasets with artificial noise and previously unseen datasets, the performance of CrackSAM far exceeds that of all state-of-the-art models. CrackSAM exhibits remarkable superiority, particularly under challenging conditions such as dim lighting, shadows, road markings, construction joints, and other interference factors. These cross-scenario results demonstrate the outstanding zero-shot capability of foundation models and provide new ideas for developing vision models in civil engineering."}

Traditional empirical models often struggle to capture the complex interactions between mechanical properties and loading conditions, particularly the influence of frequency. This study introduces a hybrid machine learning model based on the stacking ensemble strategy, integrating Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to enhance prediction accuracy. A dataset of 891 experimental results from the literature was utilized, incorporating four key input variables: compressive strength, stress ratio, maximum stress-to-strength ratio, and loading frequency. The hybrid model demonstrated superior performance (R2 = 0.965, RMSE = 0.19), outperforming individual models and established predictive equations. SHAP analysis validated the model’s interpretability and emphasized the necessity of accounting for loading frequency. This study contributes a robust and generalizable tool for fatigue life prediction within the defined input domain, offering valuable insights for engineering design and structural assessment."}
{"Paper Title": "A generalizable gated graph recurrent unit (Graph-GRU) network for nonlinear response prediction of cross-structures", "Abstract": "Accurate seismic response prediction is essential for structural safety and resilience in civil engineering. Recently, artificial intelligence has emerged as a powerful tool for efficiently modeling the response of highly nonlinear structures. However, existing models struggle to generalize across diverse structural systems, which remains a bottleneck in deep learning-enabled surrogate modeling of nonlinear structures. This paper introduces a graph gated recurrent unit network (Graph-GRU) designed to achieve generalized nonlinear structural response prediction across different structures under unseen earthquakes. The core innovation lies in the specific design of the network by integrating both seismic excitations and structural characteristics into the GRU hidden state to learn the dynamic properties of different structures and achieve the generalizability to unseen structures. Here, the structural characteristics are featured using a graph convolutional network based on the structural graph with arbitrary degrees-of-freedom. Three pooling strategies including max, average, and attention pooling are considered to calculate the global structural feature vector. Additionally, the proposed approach is compared to the state-of-the-art deep learning models. The generalizability performance of the proposed Graph-GRU network is validated across 40 unseen reinforced concrete (RC) frames with varying design parameters of story heights and floor mass distributions. Results demonstrate that the proposed Graph-GRU is capable of predicting nonlinear responses of diverse unseen structures, effectively addressing the major generalizability challenge of existing methods."}

Based on these observations, we propose DuoTransformer, a novel dual-view Transformer backbone that integrates a Transposed Transformer Encoder treating each variable as a token and a Patch Transformer Encoder for local temporal patterns, thereby enabling multi-scale modeling of both coarse-grained and fine-grained temporal dependencies. Inspired by response characteristics such as period elongation and stiffness degradation, the Physical Module is designed following a phenomenon-driven design paradigm. Furthermore, DuoTransFormer decouples the prediction process into two stages: the Physical Module, which hard-codes structural dynamics and outputs three parallel data chains as physics-informed feature sequences, and the Transformer Module, which takes them as inputs. Two proof-of-concept experiments are first conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Subsequently, extensive evaluations on two open-access structural models, including a 42-story case study building and a 632-m real-world building, demonstrate that DuoTransFormer outperforms state-of-the-art time-series forecasting models (e.g., PatchTST, iTransformer) while achieving substantially lower computational cost than finite element simulations. The model-agnostic Physical Module can be flexibly combined with all baselines to deliver substantial performance gains."}
{"Paper Title": "A multi-scale attention neural network for sensor location selection and nonlinear structural seismic response prediction", "Abstract": "Monitoring and predicting seismic responses of a civil structure can be used to assess its behavior under dynamic loading and to determine its structural health condition. In practice, the employed number of sensors is generally limited by the cost and functionality issues. This paper develops a practical solution of four-stage procedures, focusing on prediction of seismic displacement responses at all building floors using acceleration measurements at the optimized sensor locations. In this paper, a novel multi-scale attention-based recurrent neural network is proposed. In particular, the attention mechanisms in the network effectively focuses on more relevant input data among bidirectional ground accelerations and multivariate acceleration responses. The seismic response data for training the developed neural network is generated by performing nonlinear time historical analysis of a three-dimensional finite element model. A floor displacement warping loss is designed to numerically measure the discrepancy between the prediction and the ground truth. A case study is performed using the numerical and real-world data of a high-rise building to systematically evaluate the prediction performance of the proposed methodology. Results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the compared state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction accuracy and reliability."}
{"Paper Title": "Prediction of nonlinear structural response under wind loads using deep learning techniques", "Abstract": "The wind actions on buildings are continuous in nature and could range from a few minutes to more than hours. Such long duration high intensity winds can push the structure to enter post elastic structural range and cause nonlinear behavior. Therefore, unlike performance-based earthquake engineering, where the structural simulations require seismic loads acting for a few seconds, the simulations for performance-based wind engineering (PBWE) requires wind load models acting for much longer durations. However, the nonlinear 3D model of a tall building will contain thousands of connections and structural members making it a complex finite element model. Dynamic time history analysis of such a model under loads lasting for hours can be tedious and often fail to achieve convergence. Using data-driven techniques that utilizes limited numerical and field data to obtain accurate structural responses under long duration loads is an exciting alternative. Deep learning techniques have been extensively used in the studies for structural health monitoring and earthquake engineering. However, the implementation of such data-driven techniques is very limited and has the potential for exploration in problems related to wind dynamics on tall buildings. This paper aims to predict the nonlinear structural response of tall buildings under sustained durations of wind loads using deep learning models. A Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) architecture is used to assess the efficiency of data-driven methods to replace computationally intensive 3D finite element analyses. The architecture will be tested on a 150 m tall building for response predictions under long duration wind loads. The robustness of the architecture will be further evaluated with predicting the acceleration response history of a scaled aeroelastic model based on experimental studies conducted at the Wind Simulation and Testing Laboratory (WiST) at Iowa State University."}
{"Paper Title": "Recurrent neural networks for complicated seismic dynamic response prediction of a slope system", "Abstract": "Earthquake-induced landslides have resulted in huge casualties and considerable financial repercussions, and slope dynamic response analysis has always been a hot issue. The prediction of the dynamic response of a slope before the occurrence of future earthquakes will benefit disaster prevention and reduction. Traditional methods (such as the finite element method) are mostly based on simplified physical mechanisms and cannot accurately predict the dynamic response of complicated slope systems. This article innovatively applies novel recurrent neural networks to the prediction of the slope dynamic response. Using the results of large-scale shaking-table tests, we introduced a moving-steps strategy and established three recurrent neural network models: Simple-RNN, LSTM and GRU models. Moreover, a multi-layer perceptron prediction model was trained for comparative verification. We also conducted three experiments to investigate the effect of the data volume on the models. Results show that recurrent neural networks perform well in the analysis of the seismic dynamic response of a slope and provide better predictions than the multi-layer perceptron network. When there are many data, the LSTM and GRU models have advantages, and the confidence indexes of their predictions with normalized error within ±5% are 84.5% and 86.4%, respectively. It is concluded that recurrent neural networks are suitable for the time-series prediction of dynamic responses to seismic loads. To some extent, this paper may help reduce the future risks and losses of earthquake-triggered landslide disasters."}
{"Paper Title": "Deep learning for nonlinear seismic responses prediction of subway station", "Abstract": "A novel and computationally inexpensive method for predicting the nonlinear seismic response of subway stations using deep learning approaches is developed to reduce the computational cost in stochastic seismic responses analysis. The proposed method takes the deformation of the free field where the subway station is located as the input to predict seismic responses of the subway station according to the characteristic of seismic responses of underground structures. One-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) and long-short term memory (LSTM) network are adopted for seismic responses modeling of a two-story and three-span subway station in a data-driven fashion as opposed to the computational expensive physics-based finite element model. The prediction performance and extrapolating ability of both models are evaluated and compared with a baseline multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model. With the same training samples, the 1D-CNN has better prediction performance and extrapolating ability than both LSTM and the baseline MLP model and the LSTM model has the worst performance among the three models. The good prediction performance of 1D-CNN makes it suitable to be applied in the stochastic seismic responses analysis using the probability density evolution method (PDEM) which is solved by the finite-difference method (FDM). The evolution characteristics of the probability density function of the layer drift and the distribution characteristics of the peak value of layer drift can be captured by a low computational cost with the proposed method."}
{"Paper Title": "Seismic response prediction method for building structures using convolutional neural network", "Abstract": "In this study, a method of predicting the seismic responses of building structures based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed. In the method, the time histories of acceleration responses previously measured in a building during earthquakes are used in the CNN input layer, with the corresponding time histories of the displacement responses being used in the CNN output layer. The correlations between the features automatically extracted from the acceleration responses by the convolution and pooling operations in the various CNN layers and the displacement responses in the CNN output layer are established through CNN training. The trained CNN predicts the displacement responses for a future earthquake event using only the measured acceleration responses. To verify the validity of the proposed method, a numerical study on the ASCE benchmark model and an experimental study on a reinforced concrete frame structure are conducted. In the numerical study, the structural responses of the ASCE model subject to artificial earthquakes are utilized for CNN training, and the performance of the trained CNN is verified through seismic response prediction. In the experimental study, shaking table tests are performed for various earthquakes to measure the seismic responses of the reinforced concrete test structure. The seismic response prediction performance of the proposed method is examined using CNN trained with the measured seismic responses. Furthermore, the performances of CNNs trained with different numbers of datasets generated by the proposed data generation method based on data overlapping with the same data pool are discussed with related to the number of CNN training iteration number. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}
{"Paper Title": "Deep learning techniques for predicting nonlinear multi-component seismic responses of structural buildings", "Abstract": "This paper presents a new approach for nonlinear multi-component seismic response prediction of structures using hybrid deep learning techniques. Modern recurrent neural networks map the relationship between acceleration time-series of the base/ground of a building and the superstructure, as a form of nonlinear time-history analysis method. Seismic responses were measured in three components which enables multi-component seismic predictions with adequate deep learning architectures. While long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks can obtain data from a single component per surrogate model, hybrid convolutional-LSTMs (ConvLSTM) neural networks are utilized for multi-component purposes. A guide for pre-processing data and structuring the architecture of deep neural networks are proposed. Also, two filtering methods are compared, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) Butterworth filter and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) decomposition. Decimation is implemented to reduce the features to useful values, as a dimension reduction approach. With enhancements to the architecture of the network, training time can be reduced significantly, and accuracy could be further improved. A challenging case study is addressed that covers an industrial level practical building.

{"Paper Title": "Machine learning-based approaches for seismic demand and collapse of ductile reinforced concrete building frames", "Abstract": "Robust seismic vulnerability assessment for a building under expected earthquake ground motions necessitates explicit consideration of all-important sources of uncertainty in structural model idealization. This paper presents a machine learning-based methodology for reliably predicting the seismic response and structural collapse classification of ductile reinforced concrete frame buildings under future earthquake events by accounting for component- and system-level modeling uncertainties. The proposed methodology uses two different types of machine learning methods—regression-based and classification-based methods—to achieve the goal of this study. Machine learning techniques with boosting algorithms (i.e., adaptive boosting and extreme gradient boosting) are the best methods for both response prediction and collapse status classification of modern code-compliant reinforced concrete frame buildings. Finally, the effect of uncertain modeling parameters on the response and collapse identification is examined. The reinforced concrete beam modeling-related parameters (i.e., plastic deformation properties) of ductile, low-to mid-rise frame buildings are significant predictors of seismic response due to capacity design principles."}
{"Paper Title": "Prediction model of the failure mode of beam-column joints using machine learning methods", "Abstract": "Beam-column joints are important components that control the performance of reinforced concrete frame structures under seismic loads. Beam-column joint failures may induce partial or overall collapses of the structures. Brittle failure is joint shear failure before beam yielding, and ductile failure is joint shear failure after beam yielding or beam yielding without joint failure. In this study, based on the collected 580 test data of interior beam-column joints, nine features were constructed to reflect the characteristics of the joints’ design parameters. Twelve machine learning methods are applied to predict failure modes of beam-column joints. After comparing the prediction performance and comparing the results from four design codes, the prediction model provided by the XGBoost algorithm is recommended in this study for its excellent classification results of the failure modes of beam-column joints. Moreover, the SHAP method was used to explain the features’ effects in the prediction models. Accordingly, the interior beam-column joints’ failure mode can be accurately predicted, and the suggestions for changing the failure mode from brittle failure to ductility failure can be offered for the beam-column joints."}
{"Paper Title": "AI-based prediction of seismic time-history responses of RC frame structures considering varied structural parameters", "Abstract": "In this paper, an end-to-end framework for Intelligent Seismic Response Prediction, ISRPnet, is introduced. ISRPnet comprises a structural parameter module for discretizing reinforced concrete frame structures into a series of static features and an encoder-decoder architecture for encoding seismic loads and autoregressively predicting seismic responses.

ISRPnet rapidly and highly precisely predicts temporal responses for frequent earthquakes. The peak displacement predictions remain accurate for rare earthquakes. The superiority of the physical loss and the advantages of gated recurrent unit over long short-term memory are analysed in comparative experiments. Verification with unseen seismic waves beyond the training data shows the robust generalization and extrapolation capabilities of the framework.

{"Paper Title": "A Computer Vision Approach for Estimating Embodied Carbon to Support Circular Economy Decisions", "Abstract": "The circular economy of urban settlements is essential for sustainability and limiting climate change to under 2°C. While the circular economy in building stocks can be achieved through design optimized for resource recovery, challenges persist due to insufficient data on existing building stocks, material weights, and geo-locations. Urban building stock estimation and mining address these issues by mapping and analysing building resources. However, traditional urban mining methods are time-consuming, costly, and rely on expert assumptions. This study applied a novel computer vision approach and tested ResNet and DenseNet deep learning models to classify typical building facades in Australia. It automatically estimated the façade material stock and its embodied carbon. The ResNet-50 model achieved the highest performance (F1-score: 0.77, Accuracy: 0.803) and was deployed in Southport (SA 3) of the city of Gold Coast. Of the available image data, 78% was successfully inferred in Southport, while 22% remained unidentified due to the coverage limitations of open-street view images. Using model predictions, semantic data, and expert consensus, façade material stock weight was estimated, and embodied carbon coefficients were applied to account for the total embodied carbon. Results show that larger-scale autonomous stock estimation is feasible, offering significant advantages over traditional methods.

{"Paper Title": "Seeing Inside Buildings: Leveraging generative AI and multimodal data to automate building material audits", "Abstract": "Buildings account for almost 40% of global carbon emissions, and one of the most immediate and scalable strategies to reduce these emissions is to reuse existing buildings rather than construct new ones as our needs for the built environment change and grow. However, building reuse and material upcycling is often hindered by the complexity of building material audits, which require expensive site visits. We present a Generative AI approach to predict the structural and material make-up of existing buildings from multimodal geospatial, technical, and cadastre data. Leveraging a dataset of 100 buildings across the United States with corresponding building 3D scans, geolocation, and construction data, we demonstrate the capability of a stable diffusion model to reliably predict structural diagrams for subsequent estimation of material contents. Additionally, we highlight the effectiveness of combining additional diverse data inputs-from cadastre reports to photographs and satellite views-to accurately predict interior structure. Our approach aims to allow building owners to bypass the need for complex inspections and expensive expert analysis and lay the foundation for ubiquitous and affordable building material audits.

{"Paper Title": "Mapping sense of place as a measurable urban identity: Using street view images and machine learning to identify building façade materials", "Abstract": "Sense of place, as an intangible perception, is widely recognized as an urban identity and of great value in both cross-cultural studies and contemporary urbanism. Building façade material can effectively capture sense of place due to its combination of physical and social attributes. Nevertheless, there are no widely implementable and high-resolution approaches to identify façade materials on a large scale. As a response, this study proposes a method using street view images (SVIs) and a set of deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify building façade materials. Specifically, a large cross-cultural training set was built to promote generalizability. Buildings within SVIs were divided into high-resolution rectangular images and classified using a well-trained Residual Network-50 (ResNet-50) model. Sense of place and its spatial patterns were then depicted by measuring façade material and analytical indicators including diversity and continuity. Eight cities worldwide with distinctive urban identities were examined. The findings revealed that compared to Asian cities, New York City, Chicago, and London are similar, while Paris and Tokyo are more distinctive. While challenges persist in comprehensively measuring the sense of place, the analysis of façade materials offers an insightful indicator that can assist in enhancing urban identity for contemporary urbanism.

This study introduces room-specific material intensity (RSMI) and proposes a building-level material stock calculation method based on RSMI and floorplans inferred through generative adversarial networks (GANs). Using the RSMI and room-specific areas extracted from the floorplan, the proposed method can calculate material stocks that vary depending on the building design. However, building floorplans on an urban scale are generally restricted. Therefore, the proposed method uses GANs to infer floorplans by analyzing building exterior information, which is obtainable from street view imagery, offering high accessibility and facilitating spatialized analysis. The results show that the proposed method improves the material stock calculation accuracy for the volume and sum of absolute errors."}

This research aims to predict and simulate the compressive strength of concrete that replaces cement and fine aggregate with waste materials such as eggshell powder (ESP) and waste glass powder (WGP) for sustainable construction materials. In order to ensure concrete’s durability and structural integrity, a compressive strength evaluation is essential. Precise predictions maximize efficiency and advance sustainability, particularly when dealing with waste materials like ESP and WGP.

However, concrete is a heterogeneous material, and the prediction of its accurate compressive strength is challenging due to the inclusion of several non-linear parameters.

In this study, three machine learning approaches, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF), and M5P, were used for constructing the prediction model for the impact of elevated temperatures on the compressive strength of concrete modified by marble and granite construction waste powders as partial cement replacements in concrete. Dataset of 324 tested cubic specimens with four input variables, waste granite powder dose (GWP), waste marble powder (MWP), temperature (T), and duration (D) were chosen for developing the prediction models. The output was the concrete compressive strength (CS). MWP and GWP ranged between 0 and 9%, temperatures were ranged between 25 °C and 800 °C, and duration up to 2 h. Hyperparameters in the RF and XGB models were optimized using grid search. K-fold cross-validation and several statistical measures, including R2MAPE, RMSE, and MAE, were utilized to validate and check the accuracy of the proposed models. The developed models were evaluated against experimental data and previously established models. The XGB model demonstrated the highest R2 of 0.9989, alongside the lowest prediction errors: MAE of 0.1351 MPa, RMSE of 0.1842 MPa, and MAPE of 0.48%. The results showed that the XGB prediction model for the concrete compressive strength outperformed the other proposed models. The SHAP analysis, Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE), and Partial Dependence Plots (PDP) revealed that GWP and MWP positively influence the compressive strength, while the temperature exerts the most negative influence on predicting the compressive strength. Finally, a graphical user interface (GUI) for the compressive strength of concrete containing GWP and MWP subjected to elevated temperatures has been created, which may be of considerable assistance, guidance, and efficiency in research and construction industry contexts."}
{"Paper Title": "Utilizing ensemble machine learning and gray wolf optimization to predict the compressive strength of silica fume mixtures", "Abstract": "The concrete compressive strength is essential for the design and durability of concrete infrastructure. Silica fume (SF), as a cementitious material, has been shown to improve the durability and mechanical properties of concrete. This study aims to predict the compressive strength of concrete containing SF by dual-objective optimization to determine the best balance between accurate prediction and model simplicity. A comprehensive dataset of 2995 concrete samples containing SF was collected from 36 peer-reviewed studies ranging from 5% to 30% by cement weight. Input variables included curing time, SF content, water-to-cement ratio, aggregates, superplasticizer levels, and slump characteristics in the modeling process. The gray wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm was applied to create a model that balances parsimony with an acceptable error threshold. A determination coefficient (R2) of 0.973 demonstrated that the CatBoost algorithm emerged as a superior predictive tool within the boosting ensemble context. A sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of the model, identifying curing time as the predominant influence on the compressive strength of SF-containing concrete.

{"Paper Title": "Modeling of Mechanical Properties of Silica Fume-Based Green Concrete Using Machine Learning Techniques", "Abstract": "Silica fume (SF) is a frequently used mineral admixture in producing sustainable concrete in the construction sector. Incorporating SF as a partial substitution of cement in concrete has obvious advantages, including reduced CO2 emission, cost-effective concrete, enhanced durability, and mechanical properties. Due to ever-increasing environmental concerns, the development of predictive machine learning (ML) models requires time. Therefore, the present study focuses on developing modeling techniques in predicting the compressive strength of silica fume concrete. The employed techniques include decision tree (DT) and support vector machine (SVM). An extensive and reliable database of 283 compressive strengths was established from the available literature information. The six most influential factors, i.e., cement, fine aggregate, coarse aggregate, water, superplasticizer, and silica fume, were considered as significant input parameters. The evaluation of models was performed by different statistical parameters, such as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), root mean squared log error (RMSLE), and coefficient of determination (R2). Individual and ensemble models of DT and SVM showed satisfactory results with high prediction accuracy. Statistical analyses indicated that DT models bested SVM for predicting compressive strength. Ensemble modeling showed an enhancement of 11 percent and 1.5 percent for DT and SVM compressive strength models, respectively, as depicted by statistical parameters. Moreover, sensitivity analyses showed that cement and water are the governing parameters in developing compressive strength. A cross-validation technique was used to avoid overfitting issues and confirm the generalized modeling output. ML algorithms are used to predict SFC compressive strength to promote the use of green concrete."}
{"Paper Title": "Advanced Machine Learning Techniques for Predicting Concrete Compressive Strength", "Abstract": "Accurate estimation of concrete compressive strength is very important for the improvement of mix design, quality assurance, and compliance with engineering specifications. Most empirical traditional models have failed to capture the complex relationships inherent within varied constituents of concrete mixes. This paper develops a machine learning model for compressive strength prediction using mix design variables and curing age from a “Concrete Compressive Strength Dataset” obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. After comprehensive data preprocessing and feature engineering, various regression and classification models were trained and evaluated, including gradient boosting, random forest, AdaBoost, k-nearest neighbors, linear regression, and neural networks. The gradient boosting regressor (GBR) achieved the highest predictive accuracy with an R2 value of 0.94. Feature importance analysis showed that the water–cement ratio and age are the most crucial factors affecting compressive strength. Advanced methods such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values and partial dependence plots were used to attain deep insights about feature interaction with a view to enhancing interpretability and fostering trust in models. Results highlight the potential of machine learning models to improve concrete mix design with the aim of sustainable construction through the optimization of material usage and waste reduction. It is recommended that future research be undertaken with expanding datasets, more features, and richer feature engineering to enhance predictive power."}

{"Paper Title": "Machine learning-driven optimization for predicting compressive strength in fly ash geopolymer concrete", "Abstract": "This study employs machine learning (ML) techniques to predict the compressive strength (f'c) of fly ash-based geopolymer concrete, utilizing a comprehensive set of experimental data. The analysis considered variables such as fly ash (FA) components, coarse and fine aggregates, alkaline activator molarity, and other additives.

{"Paper Title": "Prediction of compressive strength of high-volume fly ash self-compacting concrete with silica fume using machine learning techniques", "Abstract": "The quality and composition of the components in Self-Compacting Concrete (SCC) determine its compressive strength; however, determining these complex relationships through traditional statistical methods is difficult. This study uses five state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, namely, Random Forest (RF), Adaboost, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BI-LSTM), to simulate the strength properties of high-volume fly ash self-compacting concrete (HVFA-SCC) with silica fume. A database with 240 SCC compressive strength tests that included a range of material proportions was put together in order to train these models. The primary constituents that were selected and taken into consideration as input variables were cement, fly ash, super-plasticizer, silica fume, coarse and fine aggregate, and age. Various statistical metrics, regression error characteristics curve, SHAP analysis, and uncertainty analysis were used to validate the models' effectiveness in predicting the compressive strength of HVFA-SCC with varying material compositions. The recommended RF model demonstrated the highest predictive accuracy of all the models that were analysed. While machine learning can predict compressive strengths, its opaque 'black-box' nature limits its use for SCC mix engineers. This study introduces an open-source Random Forest-based GUI to close this gap. This interface helps engineers make mix proportion decisions by accurately estimating SCC compressive strength under various test conditions."}
{"Paper Title": "Compressive strength of concrete material using machine learning techniques", "Abstract": "Significant efforts have been made to improve the strength of concrete by utilizing industrial waste like Fly Ash as a partial replacement of cement in the concrete. However, predicting the compressive strength of concrete is one of the challenging tasks since it is affected by several factors such as the shape and size of aggregates, water-cement ratio. The paper presents a study on the various investigation of machine learning (ML) algorithms to estimate the compressive strength (CS) of concrete containing fly ash (FA). The research also aims to compare the accuracy of different ML models, including non-ensemble models (Multiple Linear Regressor, Support Vector Regressor) and ensemble models (AdaBoost Regressor, Random Forest Regression, XGBoost Regressor, and Bagging Regressor), in predicting CS with a focus on identifying the most accurate estimation method. For this purpose, a dataset of 633 experimental results with a wide range of CS values, ranging from 6.27 MPa to 79.99 MPa, was collected from existing literature and validated using statistical analysis. The primary input parameters for the ML models included the quantities of cement, fine aggregate (FA), coarse aggregates (CA), fly ash (FA), water content, percentage of superplasticizer, and curing days, with the CS of concrete as the output. Performance evaluation was conducted using several performance indices, such as MAE, MSE, R2, MAPE, RMSE, and a20-index, to assess accuracy and reliability. The comparison reveals that XGBoost Regressor is the most reliable model, demonstrating the highest coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.95, a-20 index of 0.913, and the lowest RMSE value of 3.06 MPa and MAE of 2.13 MPa, while the Multiple LR model is the least accurate method with R2 equal to 0.52, a-20 index of 0.433, RMSE of 9.40 MPa and MAE of 7.68 MPa. Additionally, to provide deeper insights into the relationship between input parameters and CS, sensitivity and parametric analysis were employed, enabling a comprehensive understanding of the impact of fly ash and other parameters on CS prediction. From the study, it was observed that the age of the concrete is the most essential feature, followed by cement and water, with information gain values of 32.91, 23.50, and 15.10, respectively. The study highlights the effectiveness of machine learning techniques, particularly the XGBoost Regressor, in accurately estimating the compressive strength of concrete. Furthermore, it offers researchers a faster and more cost-effective means of evaluating the effect of fly ash and other factors on CS estimation, avoiding the need for time-consuming and costly experimental studies."}
{"Paper Title": "Compressive strength of nano concrete materials under elevated temperatures using machine learning", "Abstract": "In this study, four Artificial intelligence (AI) - based machine learning models were developed to estimate the Residual compressive strength (RCS) value of concrete supported with nano additives of Nanocarbon tubes (NCTs) and Nano alumina (NAl), after exposure to elevated temperatures ranging from 200 to 800 degrees. These models were developed via adapting meta- heuristic models including the Water cycle algorithm (WCA), Genetic algorithm (GA), and classical AI models of Artificial neural networks (ANNs), Fuzzy logic models (FLM), in addition to the statistical method of Multiple linear regression (MLR). 156 post heating experimental results available as a literature data (represents four input parameters of temperature change, heat exposure duration, nanomaterial type, and replacement proportion) are used to achieve the study’s objective. Results of the developed models demonstrated that ANN and FLM have strong potential in predicting RCS. However, it is often infeasible to generate practical equations that relate input and output variables from these models. Upon analysing the results of the WCA and GA, it was found that WCA yielded the most accurate predictions based on all performance indicators. Furthermore, RCS prediction equations with superior accuracy were derived utilizing the meta-heuristic AI models of WCA and GA, with Mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 3.09 kg/cm² and 3.53 kg/cm² for the training, 1.91 kg/cm² and 2.72 kg/cm² for the validation, and 1.91 kg/cm² and 2.72 kg/cm² for the testing data sets, respectively. Additionally, sensitivity analysis via neural networks weights and SHAP investigation were performed to reveals the impact and relationship of the input variables with the output variables.

Six models, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR), Random Forest Regression (RFR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Stacking and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), were evaluated. Among them, XGBoost demonstrated the best prediction accuracy, achieving a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.969 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 4.626 MPa, outperforming the other models. The Stacking model also performed well with an R2 of 0.960, though it slightly overestimated at higher compressive strength levels. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis revealed that curing time, silica fume, and aggregate content were the most significant factors influencing compressive strength. Curing time emerged as the dominant factor, significantly surpassing other variables such as silica fume and aggregate content in its impact on compressive strength. This dominance is attributed to its critical role in hydration and compressive strength development, while silica fume and aggregates primarily contributed by enhancing matrix densification and structural integrity. SHAP feature dependency analysis further highlighted complex interactions, particularly between water content and superplasticizer dosage, affecting workability and compressive strength."}

For this purpose, an experimental database consisting of 1030 records has been compiled from the machine learning repository of the University of California, Irvine. The database was used to train and validate four conventional machine learning (CML) models, namely Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Linear and Non-Linear Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS-L and MARS-C), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and Minimax Probability Machine Regression (MPMR). Subsequently, the predicted outputs of CML models were combined and trained using ANN to construct the Hybrid Ensemble Model (HENSM). It is observed that the proposed HENSM produces higher predictive accuracy compared to the CML models used in the present study. The predictive performance of all models for CS prediction was compared using the testing dataset and it is found that the HENSM model attained the highest predictive accuracy in both phases.

{"Paper Title": "Artificial Intelligence Prediction of One-Part Geopolymer Compressive Strength for Sustainable Concrete", "Abstract": "Alkali-activated materials/geopolymer (AAMs), due to their low carbon emission content, have been the focus of recent studies on ecological concrete. In terms of performance, fly ash and slag are preferred materials for precursors for developing a one-part geopolymer. However, determining the optimum content of the input parameters to obtain adequate performance is quite challenging and scarcely reported. Therefore, in this study, machine learning methods such as artificial neural networks (ANN) and gene expression programming (GEP) models were developed using MATLAB and GeneXprotools, respectively, for the prediction of compressive strength under variable input materials and content for fly ash and slag-based one-part geopolymer. The database for this study contains 171 points extracted from literature with input parameters: fly ash concentration, slag content, calcium hydroxide content, sodium oxide dose, water binder ratio, and curing temperature. The performance of the two models was evaluated under various statistical indices, namely correlation coefficient (R), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE). In terms of the strength prediction efficacy of a one-part geopolymer, ANN outperformed GEP. Sensitivity and parametric analysis were also performed to identify the significant contributor to strength. According to a sensitivity analysis, the activator and slag contents had the most effects on the compressive strength at 28 days. The water binder ratio was shown to be directly connected to activator percentage, slag percentage, and calcium hydroxide percentage and inversely related to compressive strength at 28 days and curing temperature."}
{"Paper Title": "Estimation of compressive strength of concrete with manufactured sand and natural sand using interpretable artificial intelligence", "Abstract": "To satisfy the design strength of manufactured sand concrete (MSC) in practical engineering applications, a plethora of geotechnical tests are frequently conducted. An effective approach is imperative to reduce the consumption of labor and resources during these tests. The objective of this paper is to introduce an interpretable machine learning (ML) method to evaluate the compressive strength (CS) of MSC. Firstly, a dataset was established by compiling experimental results from 208 literatures. 3382 data points were selected from the dataset for algorithm training. Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV) was employed to select input parameters. Four algorithms with 12 selected input variables and 1 output variable were constructed to predict CS of MSC using Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT), eXtreme Gradient Boosting algorithm (XGBoost), and Categorical Boosting (CatBoost). The results show that XGBoost has the highest accuracy and generalization ability (R2=0.934, MAE=3.44, RMSE=5.16, MAPE=0.07). To enhance model transparency, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) was adopted to explain the underlying predictive mechanisms of ML models. Analyses show that, 1) the cement content, curing time, and water content were the main feature parameters influencing the CS of MSC, 2) the cement content, curing time, and water content have a linear increase, logarithmic increase, and exponential decrease with the CS of MSC, respectively. Partial Dependence Plots (PDP) and Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) plots were used to further analyze the impacts of these significant influencing factors on the CS of MSC. Additionally, the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) method was employed to investigate thresholds for various material dosages in MSC containing 5–10 % stone powder. Two typical scenarios were selected for analysis, yielding recommended dosage ranges for concrete of two distinct strengths. Finally, a graphical user interface (GUI) for the CS of MSC has been designed, which might be of great use to material engineers. This provides reference and guidance for concrete engineering practice."}
