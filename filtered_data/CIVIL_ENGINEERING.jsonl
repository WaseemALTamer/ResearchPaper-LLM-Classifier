The study commences by forecasting the carbonation depth of concrete samples subjected to natural conditions, employing Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with the backpropagation algorithm. A database was created by gathering information from 870 literature sources, and it was utilized to build 100 ANN models with different topologies. A rigorous evaluation was conducted to identify the most efficient ANN architecture. Subsequently, the approach was applied in a case study to evaluate the design life of structures in a real scenario, thereby demonstrating its tangible value in real-world applications. In addition, a parametric study was undertaken to examine the material’s compressive strength and the thickness of the concrete cover, which influences its durability. The design life was determined using the Monte Carlo Simulation technique coupled with the ANN model, in which the probability of depassivation due to carbonation was forecasted. Findings indicate that decreasing the concrete cover by 25% would lead to a 48% decrease in the structure’s design life, highlighting the influence of accurately determining and implementing the thickness of the concrete cover for RC structures.", "Classification": {"Reason": "The paper studies the durability of reinforced concrete structures subjected to carbonation-induced corrosion, which is a critical aspect of civil engineering.", "Tags": ["CIVIL_ENGINEERING"]}}

{"Paper Title": "Mechanical performance of steel-polypropylene hybrid fiber reinforced concrete subject to uniaxial constant-amplitude cyclic compression: Fatigue behavior and unified fatigue equation", "Abstract": "In the natural environment, concrete-built structures are frequently undergoing repetitive loadings, e.g., earthquake, automobile traffic, or wind during their entire service life. Those repetitive cyclic loadings trigger gradual initiation, expansion and coalesce of inner cracks, resulting in progressive deterioration of mechanical performance until eventual fatigue failure. This paper presents a hybrid fiber reinforcing strategy that could significantly increase the service life of concrete. In this work, the compressive fatigue performance of steel-polypropylene hybrid fiber reinforced concrete (HFRC) under fatigue compression was investigated. A total of 36 groups of prismatic specimens were tested for various stress levels (0.7, 0.8, and 0.9). With respect to the fatigue deformation, fatigue life, and fatigue strength, the effects of fiber parameters were analyzed, including steel fiber volume fractions (1%, 1.5%, and 2%) and aspect ratios (30, 60, and 80), as well as polypropylene fiber volume fractions (0.1%, 0.15%, and 0.2%) and aspect ratios (167, 280, and 396). The results showed that the incorporation of hybrid fiber exerts a pronounced impact on the fatigue performance of concrete. Specifically, in contrast to plain concrete, the ultimate fatigue deformation and fatigue strength of HFRC could be increased by up to 63.29% and 37.18%, respectively. In addition, owing to a positive synergetic effect generated in the hybrid system, HFRC is more superior to polypropylene fiber reinforced concrete (PFRC) or steel fiber reinforced concrete (SFRC) in fatigue performance. Furthermore, a unified fatigue model was proposed to estimate the fatigue strength of HFRC with consideration of fiber parameters. The predictions were found to correlate well with available experimental results, demonstrating a wide applicability of the model in prediction of fatigue life of concrete with reasonable", "Classification": {"Reason": "The paper studies the mechanical performance of steel-polypropylene hybrid fiber reinforced concrete subject to uniaxial constant-amplitude cyclic compression, including fatigue behavior and a unified fatigue equation.", "Tags": ["CIVIL_ENGINEERING"]}}

Recently, artificial intelligence has emerged as a powerful tool for efficiently modeling the response of highly nonlinear structures. However, existing models struggle to generalize across diverse structural systems, which remains a bottleneck in deep learning-enabled surrogate modeling of nonlinear structures. This paper introduces a graph gated recurrent unit network (Graph-GRU) designed to achieve generalized nonlinear structural response prediction across different structures under unseen earthquakes. The core innovation lies in the specific design of the network by integrating both seismic excitations and structural characteristics into the GRU hidden state to learn the dynamic properties of different structures and achieve the generalizability to unseen structures. Here, the structural characteristics are featured using a graph convolutional network based on the structural graph with arbitrary degrees-of-freedom. Three pooling strategies including max, average, and attention pooling are considered to calculate the global structural feature vector. Additionally, the proposed approach is compared to the state-of-the-art deep learning models. The generalizability performance of the proposed Graph-GRU network is validated across 40 unseen reinforced concrete (RC) frames with varying design parameters of story heights and floor mass distributions.

This study developed an end-to-end physics-guided neural network with adaptive multi-level fusion outputs. Incorporating the concept of autoencoders, the network reconstructs seismic responses at non-instrumented floors based on base and roof acceleration records, and structural characteristics. The floor response spectra (FRS) are incorporated into the neural network's loss function as a physical constraint to improve prediction accuracy and enhance its physical significance. Finally, the proposed prediction model's performance and generalization ability were validated using numerical data of five reinforced concrete (RC) frame structures with varying characteristics, measured data of an RC frame shaking table test, and monitoring data of an RC frame structure under earthquake. In addition, the predicted accelerations were further applied to evaluate the damage states of non-structural components (NSCs). Results show that, for acceleration time-history prediction, the physics-informed loss function of FRS reduces absolute percentage error (APE) from 24.06 % to 20.37 %, increases cross-correlation coefficient (XR) to 0.7928, and decreases both normalized mean absolute error (NMAE) and normalized mean squared error (NMSE). For FRS prediction, APE is reduced by 3.58 % and XR rises to 0.9450. The damage assessment accuracy for NSCs reaches 76.2 %.

The effect of different angles, such as 6°, 8°, and 10° with respect to the vertical of peripheral oblique columns, was evaluated. The non-linear time history analysis was performed by taking past seismic ground motion records. The findings were collected about vertical deflection and chord rotation of the joint above the column removal position.

{"Paper Title": "Prediction of nonlinear structural response under wind loads using deep learning techniques", "Abstract": "The wind actions on buildings are continuous in nature and could range from a few minutes to more than hours. Such long duration high intensity winds can push the structure to enter post elastic structural range and cause nonlinear behavior. Therefore, unlike performance-based earthquake engineering, where the structural simulations require seismic loads acting for a few seconds, the simulations for performance-based wind engineering (PBWE) requires wind load models acting for much longer durations. However, the nonlinear 3D model of a tall building will contain thousands of connections and structural members making it a complex finite element model. Dynamic time history analysis of such a model under loads lasting for hours can be tedious and often fail to achieve convergence. Using data-driven techniques that utilizes limited numerical and field data to obtain accurate structural responses under long duration loads is an exciting alternative. Deep learning techniques have been extensively used in the studies for structural health monitoring and earthquake engineering. However, the implementation of such data-driven techniques is very limited and has the potential for exploration in problems related to wind dynamics on tall buildings. This paper aims to predict the nonlinear structural response of tall buildings under sustained durations of wind loads using deep learning models. A Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) architecture is used to assess the efficiency of data-driven methods to replace computationally intensive 3D finite element analyses. The architecture will be tested on a 150 m tall building for response predictions under long duration wind loads. The robustness of the architecture will be further evaluated with predicting the acceleration response history of a scaled aeroelastic model based on experimental studies conducted at the Wind Simulation and Testing Laboratory (WiST) at Iowa State University.", "Classification": {"Reason": "The paper studies the nonlinear structural response of tall buildings under sustained durations of wind loads using deep learning techniques, which is related to civil engineering, specifically structural engineering and wind engineering.", "Tags": ["CIVIL_ENGINEERING"]}}
{"Paper Title": "Physics-informed deep learning model in wind turbine response prediction", "Abstract": "Subjected to strong cyclic wind and wave loads, wind turbines could experience severe fatigue damages and possibly fail to function normally due to accumulated damages at certain critical locations. Therefore, fatigue damage evaluation and prediction are essential and important to be conducted, which could involve massive numerical simulations and computational costs due to dynamic analyses of the wind turbines under various environmental conditions. To reduce the calculation cost related to the time-consuming dynamic analysis, sequence models such as the recurrent neural network (RNN) and the long-short term memory model (LSTM) originated from the deep learning topic are good and promising candidates to predict structural dynamic responses at multiple critical locations under different environmental scenarios. However, the training cost and prediction accuracy of these deep learning models might not be satisfiable since these models are purely data-driven and require significant amount of training data and a large number of training parameters. To reduce the computational cost and improve the prediction accuracy, a hybrid method that integrates the physical information of the underlying wind turbine system into the data-driven model is implemented in the present study as a computationally efficient simulation model. Structural properties and linearized representations of the wind turbine system are served as the physical constraints and applied in a recently proposed deep residual recurrent neural network (DR-RNN) to form as a physics-informed deep learning model. This physics-informed model is first applied to a frame structure with four degrees of freedom as a benchmark study to show the accuracy and efficiency of this model.

First, the particular traits of the history-dependent response prediction problem are analyzed, which motivate the incorporation of the unrolled gated recurrent unit (GRU) structure and the attention mechanism into the classical Seq2Seq model in natural language processing. In the UA-Seq2Seq model, the Seq2Seq skeleton frees the restrictions on both the input and target mechanical variables. Meanwhile, the novel unrolled GRU structure conforms to the general process of mechanical simulation and manages to establish the gated links with the historical states, which is further boosted by the powerful attention mechanism dedicated to retrieving the super-long-term memory information. To quickly and informatively validate the UA-Seq2Seq model, a numerical experiment based on the cyclic stress–strain response of low-yield-point steel is conducted, whose constitutive behavior depends highly on the loading history. All the training and testing configurations in the numerical experiment are specified, including a novel data normalization method – named nonlinear reference-value scaling – tailored for mechanical variables. The results verify the effectiveness of the UA-Seq2Seq model to reproduce the history-dependent hysteresis loops and confirm its capability to capture the long-term memory effect. Furthermore, a parametric analysis is carried out to demonstrate the necessity of the unrolled structure and the attention mechanism as well as the advantage of selecting the L1 loss metric, following which a qualitative mechanical interpretation of the UA-Seq2Seq model is provided to aid in the intuitive comprehension. Finally, three feasible applications and extensions of the developed framework are introduced conceptually: integration with finite element analysis, outline analysis, and transfer learning to other similar tasks.

This paper proposes a self-excited force model based on a novel long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network to simulate the entire flutter process for various leading-edge configurations. To obtain the dataset, the nonlinear flutter with the growth stages, decay stages and steady LCOs for different leading-edge aerodynamic configurations is investigated by a series of two-degrees-of-freedom spring-suspended sectional model tests. Based on the measured flutter responses and self-excited forces in the tests, a data-driven self-excited force model is proposed on the basis of a novel LSTM neural network. Considering that the nonlinear dynamic system is very sensitive to the accuracy of the model parameters, the Newmark-B method is incorporated into the LSTM networks and forms a closed-loop process to restrain the error amplification effects and improve the model robustness, that is, the response calculated from the output of LSTM (the self-excited force) by the Newmark-B method is set as the input of LSTM at the next step rather than the measured response. To validate the performance of the proposed model, the flutter critical wind speed, time history of oscillation and self-excited forces, steady-state oscillation amplitude and flutter development process predicted by the model are compared with the test results.

The Fourier Transformer is designed to extract information from both the time and frequency domains, which reduces the time complexity by utilizing a fast Fourier transform (FFT) in place of the traditional attention mechanism in the Transformer encoder.

{"Paper Title": "Improvement of the seismic resilience of regional buildings: A multi-objective prediction model for earthquake early warning", "Abstract": "Earthquake early warning is one of the methods by which to improve structural resilience. However, uniform earthquake warning information is not highly targeted for regional buildings. Therefore, this work proposes a multi-objective earthquake warning process to provide more targeted earthquake avoidance measures for regional buildings. A multi-objective prediction model based on long short-term memory (LSTM) is established. The \"Di Ting\" dataset provided by China's National Earthquake Data Center is currently the largest artificial intelligence seismology training dataset. The proposed model uses 3 s of P-wave data from the dataset to predict the single-station magnitude, epicenter distance, and peak ground acceleration (PGA) of earthquakes. To achieve better predictive performance, the mean squared error (MSE) is redesigned. The average prediction errors of the magnitude and epicenter distance are found to be reduced, and the multi-objective model can achieve good predictive performance and meet the requirements of all the objectives. The predicted magnitude is used to determine whether an earthquake warning should be issued, the epicenter distance is used to determine the response time, and the PGA is used to determine the engineering status of the building. More targeted risk avoidance measures can be chosen for different building based on their disaster situation. The proposed multi-objective warning process can provide more targeted advice on how to avoid risks to buildings and reduce unnecessary panic and casualties.

In this work, we propose a geometry-aware semi-supervised method for fine-grained building function recognition, which effectively uses multi-source geoinformation data to achieve accurate function recognition in both single-city and cross-city scenarios. We restructured the semi-supervised method based on the Teacher–Student architecture into three stages, which involve pre-training for building facade recognition, building function annotation generation, and building function recognition. In the first stage, to enable semi-supervised training with limited annotations, we employ a semi-supervised object detection model, which trains on both labeled samples and a large amount of unlabeled data simultaneously, achieving building facade detection. In the second stage, to further optimize the pseudo-labels, we effectively utilize the geometric spatial relationships between GIS map data and panoramic street-view images, integrating the building function information with facade detection results.

Important parameters, namely cement content, silica fume, water, superplasticizer, sand, gravel, and curing age, were taken as input to predict the output, which was the compressive strength. Various regression models were investigated for the prediction of outcome compressive strength. To optimize the models, hyperparameters were tuned, and measures such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared were used for evaluation.

{"Paper Title": "Artificial Intelligence Prediction of One-Part Geopolymer Compressive Strength for Sustainable Concrete", "Abstract": "Alkali-activated materials/geopolymer (AAMs), due to their low carbon emission content, have been the focus of recent studies on ecological concrete. In terms of performance, fly ash and slag are preferred materials for precursors for developing a one-part geopolymer. However, determining the optimum content of the input parameters to obtain adequate performance is quite challenging and scarcely reported. Therefore, in this study, machine learning methods such as artificial neural networks (ANN) and gene expression programming (GEP) models were developed using MATLAB and GeneXprotools, respectively, for the prediction of compressive strength under variable input materials and content for fly ash and slag-based one-part geopolymer. The database for this study contains 171 points extracted from literature with input parameters: fly ash concentration, slag content, calcium hydroxide content, sodium oxide dose, water binder ratio, and curing temperature. The performance of the two models was evaluated under various statistical indices, namely correlation coefficient (R), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE). In terms of the strength prediction efficacy of a one-part geopolymer, ANN outperformed GEP. Sensitivity and parametric analysis were also performed to identify the significant contributor to strength. According to a sensitivity analysis, the activator and slag contents had the most effects on the compressive strength at 28 days. The water binder ratio was shown to be directly connected to activator percentage, slag percentage, and calcium hydroxide percentage and inversely related to compressive strength at 28 days and curing temperature.", "Classification": {"Reason": "The paper studies the use of machine learning methods to predict the compressive strength of one-part geopolymer concrete, which is a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to traditional concrete.

{"Paper Title": "Estimation of compressive strength of concrete with manufactured sand and natural sand using interpretable artificial intelligence", "Abstract": "To satisfy the design strength of manufactured sand concrete (MSC) in practical engineering applications, a plethora of geotechnical tests are frequently conducted. An effective approach is imperative to reduce the consumption of labor and resources during these tests. The objective of this paper is to introduce an interpretable machine learning (ML) method to evaluate the compressive strength (CS) of MSC. Firstly, a dataset was established by compiling experimental results from 208 literatures. 3382 data points were selected from the dataset for algorithm training. Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV) was employed to select input parameters. Four algorithms with 12 selected input variables and 1 output variable were constructed to predict CS of MSC using Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT), eXtreme Gradient Boosting algorithm (XGBoost), and Categorical Boosting (CatBoost). The results show that XGBoost has the highest accuracy and generalization ability (R2=0.934, MAE=3.44, RMSE=5.16, MAPE=0.07). To enhance model transparency, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) was adopted to explain the underlying predictive mechanisms of ML models. Analyses show that, 1) the cement content, curing time, and water content were the main feature parameters influencing the CS of MSC, 2) the cement content, curing time, and water content have a linear increase, logarithmic increase, and exponential decrease with the CS of MSC, respectively. Partial Dependence Plots (PDP) and Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) plots were used to further analyze the impacts of these significant influencing factors on the CS of MSC. Additionally, the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) method was employed to investigate thresholds for various material dosages in MSC containing 5–10 % stone powder. Two typical scenarios were selected for analysis, yielding recommended dosage ranges for concrete of two distinct strengths. Finally, a graphical user interface (GUI) for the CS of MSC has been designed, which might be of great use to material engineers.

However, most previous predictive studies have relied on limited datasets, excluded chemical composition effects, or used single machine-learning algorithms, leading to restricted generalization. This study evaluates and develops artificial intelligence-based ensemble learning models to predict the compressive strength of concrete incorporating waste glass powder (WGP) as a partial cement replacement. A dataset of 337 experimental results was compiled from the literature published between 2007 and 2024, including eleven key input variables such as WGP size and replacement level, water-to-cement ratio (W/C), aggregate properties, curing age, and chemical composition of WGP (SiO2, CaO, NaO). Five advanced ensemble algorithms — Gradient Boosting Regressor, Extreme Gradient Boosting Regressor, LightGBM Regressor, CatBoost Regressor, and Histogram-based Gradient Boosting regressor — were trained and optimized using Bayesian hyperparameter tuning and validated with 10-fold cross-validation. Performance was assessed using R, RMSE, MSE, MAE, and MAPE metrics. All models demonstrated excellent predictive ability (R  0.94), with CatBoost achieving the highest testing accuracy (R = 0.96, RMSE = 2.34 MPa, MAE = 1.63 MPa). Feature importance and SHAP analysis revealed curing time and W/C as the most influential parameters, followed by aggregate content and WGP replacement level. Parametric studies confirmed the expected concrete behavior, with strength gains over curing time and reductions at high WGP replacement and W/C. A graphical user interface (GUI) was developed using the CatBoost model, enabling the practical prediction of compressive strength for various mix designs.

{"Paper Title": "Mechanical performance of steel-polypropylene hybrid fiber reinforced concrete subject to uniaxial constant-amplitude cyclic compression: Fatigue behavior and unified fatigue equation", "Abstract": "In the natural environment, concrete-built structures are frequently undergoing repetitive loadings, e.g., earthquake, automobile traffic, or wind during their entire service life. Those repetitive cyclic loadings trigger gradual initiation, expansion and coalesce of inner cracks, resulting in progressive deterioration of mechanical performance until eventual fatigue failure. This paper presents a hybrid fiber reinforcing strategy that could significantly increase the service life of concrete. In this work, the compressive fatigue performance of steel-polypropylene hybrid fiber reinforced concrete (HFRC) under fatigue compression was investigated. A total of 36 groups of prismatic specimens were tested for various stress levels (0.7, 0.8, and 0.9). With respect to the fatigue deformation, fatigue life, and fatigue strength, the effects of fiber parameters were analyzed, including steel fiber volume fractions (1%, 1.5%, and 2%) and aspect ratios (30, 60, and 80), as well as polypropylene fiber volume fractions (0.1%, 0.15%, and 0.2%) and aspect ratios (167, 280, and 396). The results showed that the incorporation of hybrid fiber exerts a pronounced impact on the fatigue performance of concrete. Specifically, in contrast to plain concrete, the ultimate fatigue deformation and fatigue strength of HFRC could be increased by up to 63.29% and 37.18%, respectively. In addition, owing to a positive synergetic effect generated in the hybrid system, HFRC is more superior to polypropylene fiber reinforced concrete (PFRC) or steel fiber reinforced concrete (SFRC) in fatigue performance. Furthermore, a unified fatigue model was proposed to estimate the fatigue strength of HFRC with consideration of fiber parameters. The predictions were found to correlate well with available experimental results, demonstrating a wide applicability of the model in prediction of fatigue life of concrete with reasonable", "Classification": {"Reason": "The paper studies the mechanical performance of hybrid fiber reinforced concrete under cyclic compression, which is related to civil engineering.", "Tags": ["CIVIL_ENGINEERING"]}}

Recently, artificial intelligence has emerged as a powerful tool for efficiently modeling the response of highly nonlinear structures. However, existing models struggle to generalize across diverse structural systems, which remains a bottleneck in deep learning-enabled surrogate modeling of nonlinear structures. This paper introduces a graph gated recurrent unit network (Graph-GRU) designed to achieve generalized nonlinear structural response prediction across different structures under unseen earthquakes. The core innovation lies in the specific design of the network by integrating both seismic excitations and structural characteristics into the GRU hidden state to learn the dynamic properties of different structures and achieve the generalizability to unseen structures. Here, the structural characteristics are featured using a graph convolutional network based on the structural graph with arbitrary degrees-of-freedom. Three pooling strategies including max, average, and attention pooling are considered to calculate the global structural feature vector. Additionally, the proposed approach is compared to the state-of-the-art deep learning models. The generalizability performance of the proposed Graph-GRU network is validated across 40 unseen reinforced concrete (RC) frames with varying design parameters of story heights and floor mass distributions.

{"Paper Title": "Physics-guided neural network for structural seismic response reconstruction based on floor response spectra", "Abstract": "Structural seismic response monitoring (SSRM) systems typically can only measure responses at limited locations, leading to the incomplete attainment of dynamic responses. This study developed an end-to-end physics-guided neural network with adaptive multi-level fusion outputs. Incorporating the concept of autoencoders, the network reconstructs seismic responses at non-instrumented floors based on base and roof acceleration records, and structural characteristics. The floor response spectra (FRS) are incorporated into the neural network's loss function as a physical constraint to improve prediction accuracy and enhance its physical significance. Finally, the proposed prediction model's performance and generalization ability were validated using numerical data of five reinforced concrete (RC) frame structures with varying characteristics, measured data of an RC frame shaking table test, and monitoring data of an RC frame structure under earthquake. In addition, the predicted accelerations were further applied to evaluate the damage states of non-structural components (NSCs). Results show that, for acceleration time-history prediction, the physics-informed loss function of FRS reduces absolute percentage error (APE) from 24.06 % to 20.37 %, increases cross-correlation coefficient (XR) to 0.7928, and decreases both normalized mean absolute error (NMAE) and normalized mean squared error (NMSE). For FRS prediction, APE is reduced by 3.58 % and XR rises to 0.9450. The damage assessment accuracy for NSCs reaches 76.2 %.

The damage assessment caused by the progressive collapse of the Reinforced Concrete (RC) structure with peripheral oblique columns owing to ground-storey column removal was analyzed in this study. The effect of different angles, such as 6°, 8°, and 10° with respect to the vertical of peripheral oblique columns, was evaluated. The non-linear time history analysis was performed by taking past seismic ground motion records. The findings were collected about vertical deflection and chord rotation of the joint above the column removal position. The seismic fragility diagrams used to assess the damage to the structure were derived from Incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) curves. The probability of exceedance of certain performance stages, such as Operation phase (OP), Immediate occupancy (IO), Damaged control (DC), Life Safety (LS), and collapse prevention (CP) was discussed. Results show that structures with oblique columns could control the vertical displacement and chord rotation of the joint. The Demand capacity ratio (DCR) was lower in the models with peripheral oblique columns. Further, findings show that the two-step column removal approach was more realistic than the sudden column elimination.

{"Paper Title": "Prediction of nonlinear structural response under wind loads using deep learning techniques", "Abstract": "The wind actions on buildings are continuous in nature and could range from a few minutes to more than hours. Such long duration high intensity winds can push the structure to enter post elastic structural range and cause nonlinear behavior. Therefore, unlike performance-based earthquake engineering, where the structural simulations require seismic loads acting for a few seconds, the simulations for performance-based wind engineering (PBWE) requires wind load models acting for much longer durations. However, the nonlinear 3D model of a tall building will contain thousands of connections and structural members making it a complex finite element model. Dynamic time history analysis of such a model under loads lasting for hours can be tedious and often fail to achieve convergence. Using data-driven techniques that utilizes limited numerical and field data to obtain accurate structural responses under long duration loads is an exciting alternative. Deep learning techniques have been extensively used in the studies for structural health monitoring and earthquake engineering. However, the implementation of such data-driven techniques is very limited and has the potential for exploration in problems related to wind dynamics on tall buildings. This paper aims to predict the nonlinear structural response of tall buildings under sustained durations of wind loads using deep learning models. A Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) architecture is used to assess the efficiency of data-driven methods to replace computationally intensive 3D finite element analyses. The architecture will be tested on a 150 m tall building for response predictions under long duration wind loads.

The prediction of the dynamic response of a slope before the occurrence of future earthquakes will benefit disaster prevention and reduction. Traditional methods (such as the finite element method) are mostly based on simplified physical mechanisms and cannot accurately predict the dynamic response of complicated slope systems. This article innovatively applies novel recurrent neural networks to the prediction of the slope dynamic response. Using the results of large-scale shaking-table tests, we introduced a moving-steps strategy and established three recurrent neural network models: Simple-RNN, LSTM and GRU models. Moreover, a multi-layer perceptron prediction model was trained for comparative verification. We also conducted three experiments to investigate the effect of the data volume on the models. Results show that recurrent neural networks perform well in the analysis of the seismic dynamic response of a slope and provide better predictions than the multi-layer perceptron network.

To this end, we leverage the recent advances in deep learning and develop a physics-guided convolutional neural network (PhyCNN) for data-driven structural seismic response modeling. The concept is to train a deep PhyCNN model based on limited seismic input–output datasets (e.g., from simulation or sensing) and physics constraints, and thus establish a surrogate model for structural response prediction. Available physics (e.g., the law of dynamics) can provide constraints to the network outputs, alleviate overfitting issues, reduce the need of big training datasets, and thus improve the robustness of the trained model for more reliable prediction. The surrogate model is then utilized for fragility analysis given certain limit state criteria. In addition, an unsupervised learning algorithm based on K-means clustering is also proposed to partition the datasets to training, validation and prediction categories, so as to maximize the use of limited datasets. The performance of PhyCNN is demonstrated through both numerical and experimental examples. Convincing results illustrate that PhyCNN is capable of accurately predicting building’s seismic response in a data-driven fashion without the need of a physics-based analytical/numerical model.

This paper presents a machine learning-based methodology for reliably predicting the seismic response and structural collapse classification of ductile reinforced concrete frame buildings under future earthquake events by accounting for component- and system-level modeling uncertainties. The proposed methodology uses two different types of machine learning methods—regression-based and classification-based methods—to achieve the goal of this study. Machine learning techniques with boosting algorithms (i.e., adaptive boosting and extreme gradient boosting) are the best methods for both response prediction and collapse status classification of modern code-compliant reinforced concrete frame buildings. Finally, the effect of uncertain modeling parameters on the response and collapse identification is examined. The reinforced concrete beam modeling-related parameters (i.e., plastic deformation properties) of ductile, low-to mid-rise frame buildings are significant predictors of seismic response due to capacity design principles.", "Classification": {"Reason": "The paper studies seismic response and collapse classification of reinforced concrete building frames, which is related to structural mechanics and civil engineering.", "Tags": ["CIVIL_ENGINEERING"]}}

{"Paper Title": "Improvement of the seismic resilience of regional buildings: A multi-objective prediction model for earthquake early warning", "Abstract": "Earthquake early warning is one of the methods by which to improve structural resilience. However, uniform earthquake warning information is not highly targeted for regional buildings. Therefore, this work proposes a multi-objective earthquake warning process to provide more targeted earthquake avoidance measures for regional buildings. A multi-objective prediction model based on long short-term memory (LSTM) is established. The \"Di Ting\" dataset provided by China's National Earthquake Data Center is currently the largest artificial intelligence seismology training dataset. The proposed model uses 3 s of P-wave data from the dataset to predict the single-station magnitude, epicenter distance, and peak ground acceleration (PGA) of earthquakes. To achieve better predictive performance, the mean squared error (MSE) is redesigned. The average prediction errors of the magnitude and epicenter distance are found to be reduced, and the multi-objective model can achieve good predictive performance and meet the requirements of all the objectives. The predicted magnitude is used to determine whether an earthquake warning should be issued, the epicenter distance is used to determine the response time, and the PGA is used to determine the engineering status of the building. More targeted risk avoidance measures can be chosen for different building based on their disaster situation. The proposed multi-objective warning process can provide more targeted advice on how to avoid risks to buildings and reduce unnecessary panic and casualties.

A simplified calculation method based on the optimized result is proposed and is verified to guarantee a good performance. Additional optimization of the re-centering ratio and hybrid damping of the self-centering component provides a triangular distribution of the re-centering ratio with values of 1.14–1.26 on the lower floor and a viscous damping ratio of 0.04 to 0.07 for each floor.

In this work, we propose a geometry-aware semi-supervised method for fine-grained building function recognition, which effectively uses multi-source geoinformation data to achieve accurate function recognition in both single-city and cross-city scenarios. We restructured the semi-supervised method based on the Teacher–Student architecture into three stages, which involve pre-training for building facade recognition, building function annotation generation, and building function recognition. In the first stage, to enable semi-supervised training with limited annotations, we employ a semi-supervised object detection model, which trains on both labeled samples and a large amount of unlabeled data simultaneously, achieving building facade detection. In the second stage, to further optimize the pseudo-labels, we effectively utilize the geometric spatial relationships between GIS map data and panoramic street-view images, integrating the building function information with facade detection results. We ultimately achieve fine-grained building function recognition in both single-city and cross-city scenarios by combining the coarse annotations and labeled data in the final stage.

The study considered a wide range of literature data and examined the efficiency of boosted algorithms in predicting the strength of ordinary Portland cement concrete. A total of 1760 datapoints were gathered from the literature. In order to focus on the prediction of concrete without any pozzolanic content, the data points containing pozzolans were dropped, leaving 526 data points which were trained and tested on the selected ML algorithms. The model performances were evaluated based on mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and coefficient of determination (R2).

{"Paper Title": "Artificial Intelligence Prediction of One-Part Geopolymer Compressive Strength for Sustainable Concrete", "Abstract": "Alkali-activated materials/geopolymer (AAMs), due to their low carbon emission content, have been the focus of recent studies on ecological concrete. In terms of performance, fly ash and slag are preferred materials for precursors for developing a one-part geopolymer. However, determining the optimum content of the input parameters to obtain adequate performance is quite challenging and scarcely reported. Therefore, in this study, machine learning methods such as artificial neural networks (ANN) and gene expression programming (GEP) models were developed using MATLAB and GeneXprotools, respectively, for the prediction of compressive strength under variable input materials and content for fly ash and slag-based one-part geopolymer. The database for this study contains 171 points extracted from literature with input parameters: fly ash concentration, slag content, calcium hydroxide content, sodium oxide dose, water binder ratio, and curing temperature. The performance of the two models was evaluated under various statistical indices, namely correlation coefficient (R), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE). In terms of the strength prediction efficacy of a one-part geopolymer, ANN outperformed GEP. Sensitivity and parametric analysis were also performed to identify the significant contributor to strength. According to a sensitivity analysis, the activator and slag contents had the most effects on the compressive strength at 28 days. The water binder ratio was shown to be directly connected to activator percentage, slag percentage, and calcium hydroxide percentage and inversely related to compressive strength at 28 days and curing temperature.", "Classification": {"Reason": "The paper studies the prediction of compressive strength of geopolymer concrete using machine learning methods.", "Tags": ["CIVIL_ENGINEERING"]}}
{"Paper Title": "Estimation of compressive strength of concrete with manufactured sand and natural sand using interpretable artificial intelligence", "Abstract": "To satisfy the design strength of manufactured sand concrete (MSC) in practical engineering applications, a plethora of geotechnical tests are frequently conducted. An effective approach is imperative to reduce the consumption of labor and resources during these tests. The objective of this paper is to introduce an interpretable machine learning (ML) method to evaluate the compressive strength (CS) of MSC. Firstly, a dataset was established by compiling experimental results from 208 literatures. 3382 data points were selected from the dataset for algorithm training. Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV) was employed to select input parameters. Four algorithms with 12 selected input variables and 1 output variable were constructed to predict CS of MSC using Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT), eXtreme Gradient Boosting algorithm (XGBoost), and Categorical Boosting (CatBoost). The results show that XGBoost has the highest accuracy and generalization ability (R2=0.934, MAE=3.44, RMSE=5.16, MAPE=0.07). To enhance model transparency, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) was adopted to explain the underlying predictive mechanisms of ML models. Analyses show that, 1) the cement content, curing time, and water content were the main feature parameters influencing the CS of MSC, 2) the cement content, curing time, and water content have a linear increase, logarithmic increase, and exponential decrease with the CS of MSC, respectively. Partial Dependence Plots (PDP) and Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) plots were used to further analyze the impacts of these significant influencing factors on the CS of MSC. Additionally, the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) method was employed to investigate thresholds for various material dosages in MSC containing 5–10 % stone powder. Two typical scenarios were selected for analysis, yielding recommended dosage ranges for concrete of two distinct strengths.

This study evaluates and develops artificial intelligence-based ensemble learning models to predict the compressive strength of concrete incorporating waste glass powder (WGP) as a partial cement replacement. A dataset of 337 experimental results was compiled from the literature published between 2007 and 2024, including eleven key input variables such as WGP size and replacement level, water-to-cement ratio (W/C), aggregate properties, curing age, and chemical composition of WGP (SiO2, CaO, NaO). Five advanced ensemble algorithms — Gradient Boosting Regressor, Extreme Gradient Boosting Regressor, LightGBM Regressor, CatBoost Regressor, and Histogram-based Gradient Boosting regressor — were trained and optimized using Bayesian hyperparameter tuning and validated with 10-fold cross-validation. Performance was assessed using R, RMSE, MSE, MAE, and MAPE metrics. All models demonstrated excellent predictive ability (R  0.94), with CatBoost achieving the highest testing accuracy (R = 0.96, RMSE = 2.34 MPa, MAE = 1.63 MPa). Feature importance and SHAP analysis revealed curing time and W/C as the most influential parameters, followed by aggregate content and WGP replacement level. Parametric studies confirmed the expected concrete behavior, with strength gains over curing time and reductions at high WGP replacement and W/C.

Those repetitive cyclic loadings trigger gradual initiation, expansion and coalesce of inner cracks, resulting in progressive deterioration of mechanical performance until eventual fatigue failure. This paper presents a hybrid fiber reinforcing strategy that could significantly increase the service life of concrete. In this work, the compressive fatigue performance of steel-polypropylene hybrid fiber reinforced concrete (HFRC) under fatigue compression was investigated. A total of 36 groups of prismatic specimens were tested for various stress levels (0.7, 0.8, and 0.9). With respect to the fatigue deformation, fatigue life, and fatigue strength, the effects of fiber parameters were analyzed, including steel fiber volume fractions (1%, 1.5%, and 2%) and aspect ratios (30, 60, and 80), as well as polypropylene fiber volume fractions (0.1%, 0.15%, and 0.2%) and aspect ratios (167, 280, and 396). The results showed that the incorporation of hybrid fiber exerts a pronounced impact on the fatigue performance of concrete. Specifically, in contrast to plain concrete, the ultimate fatigue deformation and fatigue strength of HFRC could be increased by up to 63.29% and 37.18%, respectively. In addition, owing to a positive synergetic effect generated in the hybrid system, HFRC is more superior to polypropylene fiber reinforced concrete (PFRC) or steel fiber reinforced concrete (SFRC) in fatigue performance. Furthermore, a unified fatigue model was proposed to estimate the fatigue strength of HFRC with consideration of fiber parameters. The predictions were found to correlate well with available experimental results, demonstrating a wide applicability of the model in prediction of fatigue life of concrete with reasonable", "Classification": {"Reason": "The paper discusses the fatigue performance of hybrid fiber reinforced concrete, which is related to civil engineering", "Tags": ["CIVIL_ENGINEERING"]}}

Recently, artificial intelligence has emerged as a powerful tool for efficiently modeling the response of highly nonlinear structures. However, existing models struggle to generalize across diverse structural systems, which remains a bottleneck in deep learning-enabled surrogate modeling of nonlinear structures. This paper introduces a graph gated recurrent unit network (Graph-GRU) designed to achieve generalized nonlinear structural response prediction across different structures under unseen earthquakes. The core innovation lies in the specific design of the network by integrating both seismic excitations and structural characteristics into the GRU hidden state to learn the dynamic properties of different structures and achieve the generalizability to unseen structures. Here, the structural characteristics are featured using a graph convolutional network based on the structural graph with arbitrary degrees-of-freedom. Three pooling strategies including max, average, and attention pooling are considered to calculate the global structural feature vector. Additionally, the proposed approach is compared to the state-of-the-art deep learning models. The generalizability performance of the proposed Graph-GRU network is validated across 40 unseen reinforced concrete (RC) frames with varying design parameters of story heights and floor mass distributions.

This study developed an end-to-end physics-guided neural network with adaptive multi-level fusion outputs. Incorporating the concept of autoencoders, the network reconstructs seismic responses at non-instrumented floors based on base and roof acceleration records, and structural characteristics. The floor response spectra (FRS) are incorporated into the neural network's loss function as a physical constraint to improve prediction accuracy and enhance its physical significance. Finally, the proposed prediction model's performance and generalization ability were validated using numerical data of five reinforced concrete (RC) frame structures with varying characteristics, measured data of an RC frame shaking table test, and monitoring data of an RC frame structure under earthquake. In addition, the predicted accelerations were further applied to evaluate the damage states of non-structural components (NSCs). Results show that, for acceleration time-history prediction, the physics-informed loss function of FRS reduces absolute percentage error (APE) from 24.06 % to 20.37 %, increases cross-correlation coefficient (XR) to 0.7928, and decreases both normalized mean absolute error (NMAE) and normalized mean squared error (NMSE).

The effect of different angles, such as 6°, 8°, and 10° with respect to the vertical of peripheral oblique columns, was evaluated. The non-linear time history analysis was performed by taking past seismic ground motion records. The findings were collected about vertical deflection and chord rotation of the joint above the column removal position.

The probability of exceedance of certain performance stages, such as Operation phase (OP), Immediate occupancy (IO), Damaged control (DC), Life Safety (LS), and collapse prevention (CP) was discussed. Results show that structures with oblique columns could control the vertical displacement and chord rotation of the joint.

{"Paper Title": "Prediction of nonlinear structural response under wind loads using deep learning techniques", "Abstract": "The wind actions on buildings are continuous in nature and could range from a few minutes to more than hours. Such long duration high intensity winds can push the structure to enter post elastic structural range and cause nonlinear behavior. Therefore, unlike performance-based earthquake engineering, where the structural simulations require seismic loads acting for a few seconds, the simulations for performance-based wind engineering (PBWE) requires wind load models acting for much longer durations. However, the nonlinear 3D model of a tall building will contain thousands of connections and structural members making it a complex finite element model. Dynamic time history analysis of such a model under loads lasting for hours can be tedious and often fail to achieve convergence. Using data-driven techniques that utilizes limited numerical and field data to obtain accurate structural responses under long duration loads is an exciting alternative. Deep learning techniques have been extensively used in the studies for structural health monitoring and earthquake engineering. However, the implementation of such data-driven techniques is very limited and has the potential for exploration in problems related to wind dynamics on tall buildings. This paper aims to predict the nonlinear structural response of tall buildings under sustained durations of wind loads using deep learning models. A Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) architecture is used to assess the efficiency of data-driven methods to replace computationally intensive 3D finite element analyses. The architecture will be tested on a 150 m tall building for response predictions under long duration wind loads.

{"Paper Title": "Physics-informed deep learning model in wind turbine response prediction", "Abstract": "Subjected to strong cyclic wind and wave loads, wind turbines could experience severe fatigue damages and possibly fail to function normally due to accumulated damages at certain critical locations. Therefore, fatigue damage evaluation and prediction are essential and important to be conducted, which could involve massive numerical simulations and computational costs due to dynamic analyses of the wind turbines under various environmental conditions. To reduce the calculation cost related to the time-consuming dynamic analysis, sequence models such as the recurrent neural network (RNN) and the long-short term memory model (LSTM) originated from the deep learning topic are good and promising candidates to predict structural dynamic responses at multiple critical locations under different environmental scenarios. However, the training cost and prediction accuracy of these deep learning models might not be satisfiable since these models are purely data-driven and require significant amount of training data and a large number of training parameters. To reduce the computational cost and improve the prediction accuracy, a hybrid method that integrates the physical information of the underlying wind turbine system into the data-driven model is implemented in the present study as a computationally efficient simulation model. Structural properties and linearized representations of the wind turbine system are served as the physical constraints and applied in a recently proposed deep residual recurrent neural network (DR-RNN) to form as a physics-informed deep learning model.

First, the particular traits of the history-dependent response prediction problem are analyzed, which motivate the incorporation of the unrolled gated recurrent unit (GRU) structure and the attention mechanism into the classical Seq2Seq model in natural language processing. In the UA-Seq2Seq model, the Seq2Seq skeleton frees the restrictions on both the input and target mechanical variables. Meanwhile, the novel unrolled GRU structure conforms to the general process of mechanical simulation and manages to establish the gated links with the historical states, which is further boosted by the powerful attention mechanism dedicated to retrieving the super-long-term memory information. To quickly and informatively validate the UA-Seq2Seq model, a numerical experiment based on the cyclic stress–strain response of low-yield-point steel is conducted, whose constitutive behavior depends highly on the loading history. All the training and testing configurations in the numerical experiment are specified, including a novel data normalization method – named nonlinear reference-value scaling – tailored for mechanical variables. The results verify the effectiveness of the UA-Seq2Seq model to reproduce the history-dependent hysteresis loops and confirm its capability to capture the long-term memory effect. Furthermore, a parametric analysis is carried out to demonstrate the necessity of the unrolled structure and the attention mechanism as well as the advantage of selecting the L1 loss metric, following which a qualitative mechanical interpretation of the UA-Seq2Seq model is provided to aid in the intuitive comprehension. Finally, three feasible applications and extensions of the developed framework are introduced conceptually: integration with finite element analysis, outline analysis, and transfer learning to other similar tasks.

Considering that the nonlinear dynamic system is very sensitive to the accuracy of the model parameters, the Newmark-B method is incorporated into the LSTM networks and forms a closed-loop process to restrain the error amplification effects and improve the model robustness, that is, the response calculated from the output of LSTM (the self-excited force) by the Newmark-B method is set as the input of LSTM at the next step rather than the measured response. To validate the performance of the proposed model, the flutter critical wind speed, time history of oscillation and self-excited forces, steady-state oscillation amplitude and flutter development process predicted by the model are compared with the test results. The comparison indicates that the predicted results agree well with the test results, meaning that the proposed model has high accuracy, generalization and robustness in describing the nonlinear characteristics of the flutter for various aerodynamic configurations.", "Classification": {"Reason": "The paper discusses nonlinear flutter and its simulation using a novel long short-term memory neural-network-based self-excited force model.", "Tags": ["CIVIL_ENGINEERING"]}}
{"Paper Title": "Recurrent neural networks for complicated seismic dynamic response prediction of a slope system", "Abstract": "Earthquake-induced landslides have resulted in huge casualties and considerable financial repercussions, and slope dynamic response analysis has always been a hot issue. The prediction of the dynamic response of a slope before the occurrence of future earthquakes will benefit disaster prevention and reduction. Traditional methods (such as the finite element method) are mostly based on simplified physical mechanisms and cannot accurately predict the dynamic response of complicated slope systems. This article innovatively applies novel recurrent neural networks to the prediction of the slope dynamic response. Using the results of large-scale shaking-table tests, we introduced a moving-steps strategy and established three recurrent neural network models: Simple-RNN, LSTM and GRU models. Moreover, a multi-layer perceptron prediction model was trained for comparative verification. We also conducted three experiments to investigate the effect of the data volume on the models. Results show that recurrent neural networks perform well in the analysis of the seismic dynamic response of a slope and provide better predictions than the multi-layer perceptron network. When there are many data, the LSTM and GRU models have advantages, and the confidence indexes of their predictions with normalized error within ±5% are 84.5% and 86.4%, respectively. It is concluded that recurrent neural networks are suitable for the time-series prediction of dynamic responses to seismic loads.

The proposed method takes the deformation of the free field where the subway station is located as the input to predict seismic responses of the subway station according to the characteristic of seismic responses of underground structures. One-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) and long-short term memory (LSTM) network are adopted for seismic responses modeling of a two-story and three-span subway station in a data-driven fashion as opposed to the computational expensive physics-based finite element model. The prediction performance and extrapolating ability of both models are evaluated and compared with a baseline multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model. With the same training samples, the 1D-CNN has better prediction performance and extrapolating ability than both LSTM and the baseline MLP model and the LSTM model has the worst performance among the three models. The good prediction performance of 1D-CNN makes it suitable to be applied in the stochastic seismic responses analysis using the probability density evolution method (PDEM) which is solved by the finite-difference method (FDM).

In this paper, a recursive long short-term memory (LSTM) network was proposed for predicting nonlinear structural seismic responses for arbitrary lengths and sampling rates. Referring to the traditional integral solution method, the proposed LSTM model uses the recursive prediction principle and is therefore applicable to structures and earthquakes with different spectral characteristics and amplitudes. The measured ground motions and multilayer frame structures were used for model training and validation. The rules of hyperparameter selection for practical applications are herein discussed.

However, uniform earthquake warning information is not highly targeted for regional buildings. Therefore, this work proposes a multi-objective earthquake warning process to provide more targeted earthquake avoidance measures for regional buildings. A multi-objective prediction model based on long short-term memory (LSTM) is established. The \"Di Ting\" dataset provided by China's National Earthquake Data Center is currently the largest artificial intelligence seismology training dataset. The proposed model uses 3 s of P-wave data from the dataset to predict the single-station magnitude, epicenter distance, and peak ground acceleration (PGA) of earthquakes. To achieve better predictive performance, the mean squared error (MSE) is redesigned. The average prediction errors of the magnitude and epicenter distance are found to be reduced, and the multi-objective model can achieve good predictive performance and meet the requirements of all the objectives. The predicted magnitude is used to determine whether an earthquake warning should be issued, the epicenter distance is used to determine the response time, and the PGA is used to determine the engineering status of the building. More targeted risk avoidance measures can be chosen for different building based on their disaster situation.

Therefore, current MI-based material stock analysis (MSA) methods have difficulty capturing detailed material stock changes according to design variations in individual buildings and securing reliability. This study introduces room-specific material intensity (RSMI) and proposes a building-level material stock calculation method based on RSMI and floorplans inferred through generative adversarial networks (GANs). Using the RSMI and room-specific areas extracted from the floorplan, the proposed method can calculate material stocks that vary depending on the building design. However, building floorplans on an urban scale are generally restricted. Therefore, the proposed method uses GANs to infer floorplans by analyzing building exterior information, which is obtainable from street view imagery, offering high accessibility and facilitating spatialized analysis.

{"Paper Title": "Compressive strength of concrete material using machine learning techniques", "Abstract": "Significant efforts have been made to improve the strength of concrete by utilizing industrial waste like Fly Ash as a partial replacement of cement in the concrete. However, predicting the compressive strength of concrete is one of the challenging tasks since it is affected by several factors such as the shape and size of aggregates, water-cement ratio. The paper presents a study on the various investigation of machine learning (ML) algorithms to estimate the compressive strength (CS) of concrete containing fly ash (FA). The research also aims to compare the accuracy of different ML models, including non-ensemble models (Multiple Linear Regressor, Support Vector Regressor) and ensemble models (AdaBoost Regressor, Random Forest Regression, XGBoost Regressor, and Bagging Regressor), in predicting CS with a focus on identifying the most accurate estimation method. For this purpose, a dataset of 633 experimental results with a wide range of CS values, ranging from 6.27 MPa to 79.99 MPa, was collected from existing literature and validated using statistical analysis. The primary input parameters for the ML models included the quantities of cement, fine aggregate (FA), coarse aggregates (CA), fly ash (FA), water content, percentage of superplasticizer, and curing days, with the CS of concrete as the output. Performance evaluation was conducted using several performance indices, such as MAE, MSE, R2, MAPE, RMSE, and a20-index, to assess accuracy and reliability. The comparison reveals that XGBoost Regressor is the most reliable model, demonstrating the highest coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.95, a-20 index of 0.913, and the lowest RMSE value of 3.06 MPa and MAE of 2.13 MPa, while the Multiple LR model is the least accurate method with R2 equal to 0.52, a-20 index of 0.433, RMSE of 9.40 MPa and MAE of 7.68 MPa. Additionally, to provide deeper insights into the relationship between input parameters and CS, sensitivity and parametric analysis were employed, enabling a comprehensive understanding of the impact of fly ash and other parameters on CS prediction. From the study, it was observed that the age of the concrete is the most essential feature, followed by cement and water, with information gain values of 32.91, 23.50, and 15.10, respectively. The study highlights the effectiveness of machine learning techniques, particularly the XGBoost Regressor, in accurately estimating the compressive strength of concrete. Furthermore, it offers researchers a faster and more cost-effective means of evaluating the effect of fly ash and other factors on CS estimation, avoiding the need for time-consuming and costly experimental studies.", "Classification": {"Reason": "The paper discusses the application of machine learning techniques to predict the compressive strength of concrete, which is a civil engineering topic.", "Tags": ["CIVIL_ENGINEERING"]}}

These models were developed via adapting meta- heuristic models including the Water cycle algorithm (WCA), Genetic algorithm (GA), and classical AI models of Artificial neural networks (ANNs), Fuzzy logic models (FLM), in addition to the statistical method of Multiple linear regression (MLR). 156 post heating experimental results available as a literature data (represents four input parameters of temperature change, heat exposure duration, nanomaterial type, and replacement proportion) are used to achieve the study’s objective. Results of the developed models demonstrated that ANN and FLM have strong potential in predicting RCS. However, it is often infeasible to generate practical equations that relate input and output variables from these models. Upon analysing the results of the WCA and GA, it was found that WCA yielded the most accurate predictions based on all performance indicators. Furthermore, RCS prediction equations with superior accuracy were derived utilizing the meta-heuristic AI models of WCA and GA, with Mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 3.09 kg/cm² and 3.53 kg/cm² for the training, 1.91 kg/cm² and 2.72 kg/cm² for the validation, and 1.91 kg/cm² and 2.72 kg/cm² for the testing data sets, respectively.

Six models, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR), Random Forest Regression (RFR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Stacking and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), were evaluated. Among them, XGBoost demonstrated the best prediction accuracy, achieving a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.969 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 4.626 MPa, outperforming the other models. The Stacking model also performed well with an R2 of 0.960, though it slightly overestimated at higher compressive strength levels. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis revealed that curing time, silica fume, and aggregate content were the most significant factors influencing compressive strength. Curing time emerged as the dominant factor, significantly surpassing other variables such as silica fume and aggregate content in its impact on compressive strength. This dominance is attributed to its critical role in hydration and compressive strength development, while silica fume and aggregates primarily contributed by enhancing matrix densification and structural integrity.

For this purpose, an experimental database consisting of 1030 records has been compiled from the machine learning repository of the University of California, Irvine. The database was used to train and validate four conventional machine learning (CML) models, namely Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Linear and Non-Linear Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS-L and MARS-C), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and Minimax Probability Machine Regression (MPMR). Subsequently, the predicted outputs of CML models were combined and trained using ANN to construct the Hybrid Ensemble Model (HENSM).

The predictive performance of all models for CS prediction was compared using the testing dataset and it is found that the HENSM model attained the highest predictive accuracy in both phases.

{"Paper Title": "Machine learning-based compressive strength prediction for concrete: An adaptive boosting approach", "Abstract": "In this paper, an intelligent approach based on the machine learning technique is proposed for predicting the compressive strength of concrete. This approach employs the adaptive boosting algorithm to construct a strong learner by integrating several weak learners, which can find the mapping between the input data and output data. The weak learner whose predicting error is small will have a larger weight in the entire system, thus the overall accuracy of the strong learner will be enhanced. A total of 1030 sets of concrete compressive strength tests is collected to train and test the learners, in which the concrete mixture components (e.g., coarse/fine aggregates, cement, water, additive, etc.) and the curing time are set as the input data while the compressive strength value is set as the output data. The proposed approach is validated through a 10-fold cross validation method, and reaches an average accuracy of over 95% in sense of determination coefficient. In addition, a new dataset of 103 samples for concrete compressive strength is also adopted to demonstrate the generalization power of the proposed mode. The proposed approach is also compared to some other individual machine learning techniques that are already applied in this field, e.g., artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM), and shows superior advantages over these methods. Finally, the influence of some key factors in the adaptive boosting approach is also investigated, e.g., the amount of training data, the choice of weak learner, and the influence of the sensitivity and number of the input parameters. It is shown that using 80% of the total data for training can obtain acceptable prediction results and decision tree is the best choice for the weak learner in the boosting framework.

In terms of performance, fly ash and slag are preferred materials for precursors for developing a one-part geopolymer. However, determining the optimum content of the input parameters to obtain adequate performance is quite challenging and scarcely reported. Therefore, in this study, machine learning methods such as artificial neural networks (ANN) and gene expression programming (GEP) models were developed using MATLAB and GeneXprotools, respectively, for the prediction of compressive strength under variable input materials and content for fly ash and slag-based one-part geopolymer. The database for this study contains 171 points extracted from literature with input parameters: fly ash concentration, slag content, calcium hydroxide content, sodium oxide dose, water binder ratio, and curing temperature. The performance of the two models was evaluated under various statistical indices, namely correlation coefficient (R), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE). In terms of the strength prediction efficacy of a one-part geopolymer, ANN outperformed GEP. Sensitivity and parametric analysis were also performed to identify the significant contributor to strength.

An effective approach is imperative to reduce the consumption of labor and resources during these tests. The objective of this paper is to introduce an interpretable machine learning (ML) method to evaluate the compressive strength (CS) of MSC. Firstly, a dataset was established by compiling experimental results from 208 literatures. 3382 data points were selected from the dataset for algorithm training. Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV) was employed to select input parameters. Four algorithms with 12 selected input variables and 1 output variable were constructed to predict CS of MSC using Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT), eXtreme Gradient Boosting algorithm (XGBoost), and Categorical Boosting (CatBoost). The results show that XGBoost has the highest accuracy and generalization ability (R2=0.934, MAE=3.44, RMSE=5.16, MAPE=0.07). To enhance model transparency, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) was adopted to explain the underlying predictive mechanisms of ML models. Analyses show that, 1) the cement content, curing time, and water content were the main feature parameters influencing the CS of MSC, 2) the cement content, curing time, and water content have a linear increase, logarithmic increase, and exponential decrease with the CS of MSC, respectively. Partial Dependence Plots (PDP) and Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) plots were used to further analyze the impacts of these significant influencing factors on the CS of MSC. Additionally, the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) method was employed to investigate thresholds for various material dosages in MSC containing 5–10 % stone powder. Two typical scenarios were selected for analysis, yielding recommended dosage ranges for concrete of two distinct strengths.

Bias risk and concerns were evaluated using the PROBAST checklist. This study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024622930). Results: Thirty-five studies encompassing 162 estimates were included. The pooled sensitivity was 0.747 (95% CI: 0.715–0.775) and specificity was 0.746 (95% CI: 0.706–0.783). The pooled DOR was 9.45 (95% CI: 7.27–12.28), indicating a strong association between AI predictions and actual metastatic status. The overall AUC-ROC was 0.818.

{"Paper Title": "“Enhancing early detection of oral cancer: a comparative study of artificial intelligence models and clinical specialist in lesion classification”", "Abstract": "Background: Oral cancer remains a major global health issue, with timely diagnosis being essential due to its varied clinical presentation. This study explores how artificial intelligence (AI) can support early detection by analyzing intraoral photographs. Methods: A cross-sectional analysis was performed using 518 intraoral clinical images collected from the Department of Oral Medicine, Kerman Faculty of Dentistry, between 2009 and 2023. The dataset comprised 104 images of malignant lesions and 414 of benign or normal tissue, all confirmed by a specialist in oral pathology. Three pretrained deep learning models, DenseNet-121, EfficientNet-B0, and ResNet-50, were evaluated for their ability to classify lesions as malignant or benign. The data were split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets, with preprocessing completed before analysis. Results: Among the models, DenseNet-121 demonstrated superior performance, achieving 91% accuracy, 75% sensitivity, 98% specificity, 75% positive predictive value, 96% negative predictive value, an F1 score of 84%, and an area under the curve of 90%. These results exceeded the diagnostic accuracy of an experienced oral specialist. Conclusion: AI-based analysis of clinical images can significantly improve early oral cancer detection and should be integrated into clinical workflows to enhance diagnostic precision. © The Author(s) 2025.", "Classification": {"Reason": "The paper discusses the application of artificial intelligence in oral cancer detection, which is related to the field of civil engineering in terms of structural and material analysis.", "Tags": ["CIVIL_ENGINEERING"]}}
{"Paper Title": "The value for money of artificial intelligence-empowered precision medicine: a systematic review and regression analysis", "Abstract": "Artificial intelligence has empowered precision medicine (AI-PM) to transform healthcare. This study synthesized available evidence on the cost-effectiveness of AI-PM. We systematically searched five major databases for economic evaluations of AI-PM, extracted data, and assessed risk-of-bias using the Bias in Economic Evaluation (ECOBIAS) checklist. For cost-utility analyses, the value-for-money was quantitatively summarized, and regression analyses incorporating machine learning were conducted to explore value heterogeneity. Forty-eight economic evaluations were included, of which 31 were cost-utility analyses. Although risk-of-bias assessment indicated potential systematic optimism, AI-PM was cost-saving or cost-effective in 89% of base-case analyses, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranging from dominant to $129,174/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Interquartile ranges of incremental costs (−$259 to $28), QALY gains (0.001–0.019), and net monetary benefits (NMB; $18 to $986 at a willingness-to-pay threshold equal to one-time per-capita GDP) indicated modest health gains at minimal additional costs, and likely high value heterogeneity. Modeling choices and system-level factors were identified as essential sources of heterogeneity in estimated NMBs. Additional value assessment revealed low adaptability and underreported key value factors, leaving significant uncertainties in AI-PM adoption. © The Author(s) 2025.", "Classification": {"Reason": "The paper discusses the cost-effectiveness of AI-PM, which is a healthcare-related topic.", "Tags": ["CIVIL_ENGINEERING"]}}
{"Paper Title": "Assessment of Serum Ferritin Levels and Periodontal Indices in Patients with Chronic Periodontitis Post/Pre Radiation Treatment of Head and Neck Cancer; Evaluación de los niveles séricos de ferritina e índices periodontales en pacientes con periodontitis crónica antes y después del tratamiento con radioterapia por cáncer de cabeza y cuello", "Abstract": "Acute phase protein (APP) positivity is exhibited by ferritin in the presence of inflammation and chronic infections, such as periodontal disease. This study aims to investigate serum ferritin levels compared between post-and pre-radiation of periodontal disease with head and neck cancer PD+HNC. A total of 100 individuals in the present study were enrolled, comprising 50 patient’s periodontal disease (PD) with head and neck cancer who underwent radiotherapy post-six months (post-RT HNC) and 50 PD patients (pre-RT HNC). Probing pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL), gingival bleeding index (GBI), plaque index (PI), oral pH, and hyposalivation were noted. Serum ferritin levels were measured using an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (eCLIA). A significantly higher percentage of ferritin levels was found in patients post-RT PD+HNC (301.90 ng/ml) contrasted to pre-RT PD+HNC (82.71 ng/ ml) subjects. Serum ferritin levels were shown to be significantly positively correlated with CAL, PPD, PI, and GBI in subjects with chronic periodontitis. Receiver operating characteristic results of ferritin (area under the curve (AUC) =0.806 for post-RT PD+HNC, AUC=0.454 for pre-RT PD+HNC). It may be suggested that elevated serum ferritin levels in patients with post-RT PD+HNC have the potential to be evaluated as biomarkers for inflammation during periodontal tissue breakdown via radiation treatment. © 2025 Ahmed A.

{"Paper Title": "Development of a low-cost Raspberry Pi-based electric piezocone system for cone penetration testing", "Abstract": "This study presents the development of a cost-effective Raspberry Pi-based electric piezocone system for Cone Penetration Testing with pore pressure measurement (CPTu). By utilizing a Raspberry Pi 4B as the data acquisition system (DAS), the proposed system offers a viable alternative to high-cost commercial geotechnical equipment, particularly in developing regions such as Bolivia. The system integrates high-precision sensors to measure tip resistance (q<inf>c</inf> ), sleeve friction (f<inf>s</inf> ), and pore-water pressure (u<inf>2</inf> ), ensuring accurate real-time soil characterization. Field validation demonstrated a strong correlation between the Raspberry Pi-based system and a commercial CPTu, with Pearson’s r coefficients of 0.69 for sleeve friction and 0.59 for tip resistance. The root mean square error (RMSE) for tip resistance was 2.236 MPa. At the same time, for sleeve friction, it was 46.143 kPa, indicating that while the system provides reliable data, further calibration may improve accuracy. The soil classification results identified predominant layers of stiff sand and sand with silt, aligning with conventional CPTu interpretations. The affordability and adaptability of this system make it a practical solution for geotechnical investigations in resource-constrained environments, offering a functional alternative at a significantly lower cost than commercial CPTu systems. The use of open-source technology also enables real-time data monitoring, customization, and potential integration with machine learning for automated soil classification. Future research will focus on refining sensor calibration, enhancing data analytics, and expanding Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities to improve remote monitoring and streamline geotechnical testing applications. © 2026, Associacao Brasileira de Mecanica dos Solos.
