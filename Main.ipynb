    "    \"Abstract\": \"The lack of data on existing buildings hinders efforts towards repair, reuse, and recycling of materials, which are crucial for mitigating the climate crisis. Manual acquisition of building data is complex and time-consuming, but combining street-level imagery with computer vision could significantly scale-up building materials documentation. We formulate the problem of building facade material detection as a multi-label classification task and present a method using GIS and street view imagery with just a few hundred annotated samples and a fine-tuned image classification model. Our method shows strong performance with macro-averaged F1 scores of 0.91 for Tokyo, 0.91 for NYC, 0.96 for Zurich, and 0.93 for the merged dataset. By utilizing open-access and non-proprietary data, our method can be scaled-up step by step to a global level. We make our in the wild dataset publicly available as the Urban Resource Cadastre Repository to encourage future work on automatic building material detection.\"\n",

    "    \"Abstract\": \"The third-order elastic (TOE) model has been used to describe the widely observed nonlinear mechanical behaviors of earth materials. In addition to linear elastic constants (?, µ), three nonlinear elastic moduli (A, B, C) are required for isotropic rocks. Contrary to previous research on dynamic TOE moduli, this study followed the protocol to measure strain and stress under uniaxial and hydrostatic compressive tests statically, which were later used to invert for the full set of TOE moduli for four standard rock types with differing pore structures of a porous oolitic limestone, quartz-rich sandstones, and a dense crystalline basalt. The applicability of the TOE model to characterize nonlinearity depends on the fulfillment of path-independence and small-strain assumptions. Using the measured static TOE moduli, the finite element model demonstrates that the stress in the vicinity of the wellbore is more amplified than the stress in the linear elastic case, which leads to a wider zone of rock failure around the wellbore. Due to the long-standing discrepancy between static and dynamic moduli, the rarely reported full set of static TOE moduli is necessary and will benefit future research in understanding the effect of rock nonlinearity on geophysical and geomechanical applications, such as long-term safe storage of CO<inf>2</inf> and generating process of geohazards. © 2024 The Author(s).\"\n",
