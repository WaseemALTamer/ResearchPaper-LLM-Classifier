Development of a low-cost Raspberry Pi-based electric piezocone system for cone penetration testing,"This study presents the development of a cost-effective Raspberry Pi-based electric piezocone system for Cone Penetration Testing with pore pressure measurement (CPTu). By utilizing a Raspberry Pi 4B as the data acquisition system (DAS), the proposed system offers a viable alternative to high-cost commercial geotechnical equipment, particularly in developing regions such as Bolivia. The system integrates high-precision sensors to measure tip resistance (q<inf>c</inf> ), sleeve friction (f<inf>s</inf> ), and pore-water pressure (u<inf>2</inf> ), ensuring accurate real-time soil characterization. Field validation demonstrated a strong correlation between the Raspberry Pi-based system and a commercial CPTu, with Pearson’s r coefficients of 0.69 for sleeve friction and 0.59 for tip resistance. The root mean square error (RMSE) for tip resistance was 2.236 MPa. At the same time, for sleeve friction, it was 46.143 kPa, indicating that while the system provides reliable data, further calibration may improve accuracy. The soil classification results identified predominant layers of stiff sand and sand with silt, aligning with conventional CPTu interpretations. The affordability and adaptability of this system make it a practical solution for geotechnical investigations in resource-constrained environments, offering a functional alternative at a significantly lower cost than commercial CPTu systems. The use of open-source technology also enables real-time data monitoring, customization, and potential integration with machine learning for automated soil classification. Future research will focus on refining sensor calibration, enhancing data analytics, and expanding Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities to improve remote monitoring and streamline geotechnical testing applications. © 2026, Associacao Brasileira de Mecanica dos Solos.

Assessment of Serum Ferritin Levels and Periodontal Indices in Patients with Chronic Periodontitis Post/Pre Radiation Treatment of Head and Neck Cancer; Evaluación de los niveles séricos de ferritina e índices periodontales en pacientes con periodontitis crónica antes y después del tratamiento con radioterapia por cáncer de cabeza y cuello,"Acute phase protein (APP) positivity is exhibited by ferritin in the presence of inflammation and chronic infections, such as periodontal disease. This study aims to investigate serum ferritin levels compared between post-and pre-radiation of periodontal disease with head and neck cancer PD+HNC. A total of 100 individuals in the present study were enrolled, comprising 50 patient’s periodontal disease (PD) with head and neck cancer who underwent radiotherapy post-six months (post-RT HNC) and 50 PD patients (pre-RT HNC). Probing pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL), gingival bleeding index (GBI), plaque index (PI), oral pH, and hyposalivation were noted. Serum ferritin levels were measured using an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (eCLIA). A significantly higher percentage of ferritin levels was found in patients post-RT PD+HNC (301.90 ng/ml) contrasted to pre-RT PD+HNC (82.71 ng/ ml) subjects. Serum ferritin levels were shown to be significantly positively correlated with CAL, PPD, PI, and GBI in subjects with chronic periodontitis. Receiver operating characteristic results of ferritin (area under the curve (AUC) =0.806 for post-RT PD+HNC, AUC=0.454 for pre-RT PD+HNC). It may be suggested that elevated serum ferritin levels in patients with post-RT PD+HNC have the potential to be evaluated as biomarkers for inflammation during periodontal tissue breakdown via radiation treatment. © 2025 Ahmed A.

The value for money of artificial intelligence-empowered precision medicine: a systematic review and regression analysis,"Artificial intelligence has empowered precision medicine (AI-PM) to transform healthcare. This study synthesized available evidence on the cost-effectiveness of AI-PM. We systematically searched five major databases for economic evaluations of AI-PM, extracted data, and assessed risk-of-bias using the Bias in Economic Evaluation (ECOBIAS) checklist. For cost-utility analyses, the value-for-money was quantitatively summarized, and regression analyses incorporating machine learning were conducted to explore value heterogeneity. Forty-eight economic evaluations were included, of which 31 were cost-utility analyses. Although risk-of-bias assessment indicated potential systematic optimism, AI-PM was cost-saving or cost-effective in 89% of base-case analyses, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranging from dominant to $129,174/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Interquartile ranges of incremental costs (−$259 to $28), QALY gains (0.001–0.019), and net monetary benefits (NMB; $18 to $986 at a willingness-to-pay threshold equal to one-time per-capita GDP) indicated modest health gains at minimal additional costs, and likely high value heterogeneity. Modeling choices and system-level factors were identified as essential sources of heterogeneity in estimated NMBs. Additional value assessment revealed low adaptability and underreported key value factors, leaving significant uncertainties in AI-PM adoption. © The Author(s) 2025."

A scoping review of explainable artificial intelligence in sports science,"Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are increasingly being applied in sports science to predict performance, assess injury risk, and support tactical decision-making. However, the opacity of many machine learning (ML) models has led to a growing interest in explainable AI (XAI) methods, which aim to make the decisions of ""black box"" algorithms more transparent and interpretable. The result of this is an increase in trust, facilitation of model validation, and enablement of more informed decision-making for practitioners and analysts. While XAI is well established in domains like healthcare or finance, its application in sports science remains fragmented and underexplored. This scoping review follows the PRISMA-Sc approach and systematically examines how XAI and interpretable ML techniques have been applied in the context of sports science. Between 2014 and June 2024, a total of 19 studies were identified through a multi-database search and analyzed in terms of sport type, ML model, XAI method, dependent variable, limitations, challenges and future research. The results reveal a clear dominance of SHapley Additive Explanations across multiple disciplines, while other tools such as Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping, Individual Conditional Expectation Plots, or domain-specific approaches are rarely used. Visual and rule-based explanation methods were largely absent. The findings highlight a lack of methodological diversity and limited validation of explanations with domain experts or practitioners. To increase real-world impact, future work should explore comparative evaluations of XAI techniques, domain-specific explanation frameworks, and user-centered approaches that align with the needs of coaches, athletes, and analysts. © The Author(s) 2025."

The Use of Artificial Intelligence for Personalized Treatment in Psychiatry,"Purpose of Review: This review examines the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in psychiatry in the past 5 years across four domains: screening; outcome prediction; risk and relapse prediction; and psychotherapy. Recent Findings: Machine learning models applied to questionnaires, electronic health records, neuroimaging, and digital phenotyping data demonstrate promising results for predicting symptom trajectories, relapse risk and treatment response, but external and clinical validation is rare. Randomized controlled trials provide some evidence for AI-enabled clinical decision support, but only preliminary evidence for chatbot-delivered psychotherapy. Some preliminary evidence for chatbots in screening exists. Ethical risks, including automation bias, model opacity and socioemotional harms, complicate integration into practice. Summary: Current evidence only supports AI’s role as a complement to clinical expertise. To realize safe integration of AI into clinical practice, future work should focus on prospective, multi–site trials with active comparators, external validation across diverse populations, transparent reporting, and governance frameworks that prioritize explainability, oversight, and equity. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025."
Machine learning-based surrogate model for bubble dynamics and cavitation behaviour under sinusoidal waves,"A machine learning-based surrogate model for bubble dynamics and cavitation behavior under sinusoidal waves has broad applications in science and engineering. In biomedical ultrasound, it can predict the nonlinear oscillations of microbubbles for targeted drug delivery, suboperation, and high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) therapy, thereby enhancing treatment safety and efficiency. In underwater acoustics and naval engineering, such models help analyze cavitation around ship propellers and sonar devices, reducing noise, vibration, and material erosion. Similarly, in energy systems like hydropower turbines, compressors, and pumps, surrogate models accelerate the prediction of cavitation-related performance losses and blade damage, supporting more reliable design and operation. In order to find anomalies, cancers, and other medical issues, it is also used to evaluate organs like the liver, kidneys, heart, and blood arteries. Fluid dynamics difficulties have been greatly impacted by the development of contemporary simulation tools such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). This study employs an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based machine learning technique to analyze the behavior of spherical gas bubbles in Carreau fluids when exposed to an ambient sonic field. The developed dynamical system is trained using an ANN application, specifically the Levenberg–Marquardt Scheme (LMS), a highly nonlinear and complex network. ANN approximation utilizes the Adam optimizer function to evaluate the numerical solution of the problem. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is tested through the computation of MSE and the comparison of the optimal curve function against the iterative approach. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025."
AI-driven multi-omics integration in precision oncology: bridging the data deluge to clinical decisions,"Cancer’s staggering molecular heterogeneity demands innovative approaches beyond traditional single-omics methods. The integration of multi-omics data, spanning genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and radiomics, can improve diagnostic and prognostic accuracy when accompanied by rigorous preprocessing and external validation; for example, recent integrated classifiers report AUCs around 0.81–0.87 for difficult early-detection tasks. This review synthesizes how artificial intelligence (AI), particularly deep learning and machine learning, bridges this gap by enabling scalable, non-linear integration of disparate omics layers into clinically actionable insights. We explore cutting-edge AI methodologies, including graph neural networks for biological network modeling, transformers for cross-modal fusion, and explainable AI (XAI) for transparent clinical decision support. Critical applications are highlighted, such as AI-driven therapy selection (e.g., predicting targeted therapy resistance), proteogenomic early detection, and radiogenomic non-invasive diagnostics. We further address translational challenges: data harmonization, batch correction, missing data imputation, and computational scalability. Emerging trends, federated learning for privacy-preserving collaboration, spatial/single-cell omics for microenvironment decoding, quantum computing, and patient-centric “N-of-1” models, signal a paradigm shift toward dynamic, personalized cancer management.
